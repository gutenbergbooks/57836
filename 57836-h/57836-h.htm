<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;margin-bottom:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Dear Mistress of Bassetts</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>You and Audrey have so often proclaimed the need—in
our world of sorrow and care—of a “bland” novel,
defining it as one to be read when in bed with a sore throat,
that as an adventurer in letters I have frequently felt
tempted to write one for you. But the spirit bloweth
where it listeth, and seemed perversely to have turned
against novels altogether, perhaps because I had been
labelled “novelist,” as though one had set up a factory.
(Two a year is, I believe, the correct output.) However,
here is a novel at last—my first this century—and there
is a further reason for presuming to associate you with it,
because it is largely from the vantage-point of your Essex
homestead that I have, during the past twenty years,
absorbed the landscape, character, and dialect which finally
insisted on finding expression, first in a little play, and now
in this elaborate canvas. How often have I passed over
High Field and seen the opulent valley—tilth and pasture
and ancient country seats—stretching before me like a great
poem, with its glint of winding water, and the exquisite
blue of its distances, and Bassetts awaiting me below,
snuggling under its mellow moss-stained tiles, a true English
home of “plain living and high thinking,” and latterly of the
rural Muse! I can only hope that some breath of the inspiration
which has emanated from Bassetts in these latter
days, and which has set its picturesquely clad poetesses
turning rhymes as enthusiastically as clods, and weaving
rondels as happily as they bound the sheaves, has been
wafted over these more prosaic pages—something of that
“wood-magic” which your granddaughter—soul of the
idyllic band—has got into her song of your surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet it must not be thought that either “Bassetts”
or “Little Baddow” figures in the “Little Bradmarsh”
of my story. The artist cannot be tied down: he creates
a composite landscape to his needs. Moreover, in these last
four or five years a zealous constabulary can testify out
of what odds and ends the strange inquiring figure, who
walked, cycled, or rode in carriers’ carts to forgotten hamlets
or sea-marshes, has composed his background. Nor have I
followed photographic realism even in my dialect, deeming
the Cockneyish forms, except when unconsciously amusing,
too ugly to the eye in a long sustained narrative, though
enjoyable enough in those humorous sketches which my
friend Bensusan, the true conquistador of Essex, pours forth
so amazingly from his inexhaustible cornucopia. I differ—in
all diffidence—from his transcription on the sole point
that the Essex rustic changes “i” into “oi” in words like
“while,” though why on the other hand “boil” should go
back to “bile” can be explained only by the perversity
which insists on taking aspirates off the right words and
clapping them on the wrong, much as Cockney youths and
girls exchange hats on Bank Holiday. I have limited my
own employment of this local vowelling mainly to the first
person singular as sufficiently indicative of the rest. In the
old vexed question of the use of dialect, my feeling is that
its value is simply as colour, and that the rich old words,
obsolete or unknown elsewhere, contribute this more effectively
and far more beautifully than vagaries of pronunciation,
itself a very shifting factor of language even in the
best circles. It is not even necessary for the artistic effect
that the reader should understand the provincial words,
though the context should be so contrived as to make
them fairly intelligible. In short, art is never nature,
though it should conceal the fact. Even the slowness and
minuteness of my method—imposed as it is by the attempt
to seize the essence of Essex—are immeasurable velocity and
breadth compared with the scale of reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In bringing this rustic complex under the category of
comedy I clash, I am aware, with literary fashion, which
demands that country folk should appear like toiling insects
caught in the landscape as in a giant web of Fate, though
why the inhabitants of Belgravia or Clapham escape this
tragic convention I cannot understand. But I do not think
that you, dear Aunt by adoption, see the life around you like
that. Even, however, had you and I seen more gloomily,
the fashionable fatalistic framework would have been clearly
inconsistent with the “blandness” of your novel. Such
a novel must, I conceive, begin with “once upon a time”
and end with “they all lived happy ever after,” so that my
task was simply to fill in the lacuna between these two
points, and supply the early-Victorian mottoes, while even
the material was marked out for me by Dr. Johnson’s definition
of a novel as “a story mainly about love.” I am hopeful
that when you come to read it (not, I trust, with a sore
throat), you will admit that I have at least tried to make my
dear “Jinny” really “live happy ever after,” even though—in
the fierce struggle for literary survival—she is far from
likely to do so. But at any rate, if only for the moment,
I should be glad if I had succeeded in expressing through
her my grateful appreciation of the beautiful country in
which my lot, like Jinny’s, has been cast, with its many
lovable customs and simple, kindly people.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Once</span> upon a time—but then it was more than once, it was, in
fact, every Tuesday and Friday—Jinny the Carrier, of Blackwater
Hall, Little Bradmarsh, went the round with her tilt-cart
from that torpid Essex village on the Brad, through Long
Bradmarsh (over the brick bridge) to worldly, bustling Chipstone,
and thence home again through the series of droughty hamlets
with public pumps that curved back—if one did not take the
wrong turning at the Four Wantz Way—to her too aqueous
birthplace: baiting her horse, Methusalem, at “The Black
Sheep” in Chipstone like the other carters and wagoners, sporting
a dog with a wicked eye and a smart collar, and even blowing a
horn as if she had been the red-coated guard of the Chelmsford
coach sweeping grandly to his goal down the High Street of
Chipstone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you question more precisely when this brazen female
flourished? The answer may be given with the empty exactitude
of science and scholarship. Her climacteric was to the globe at
large the <span class='it'>annus mirabilis</span> of the Great Exhibition, when the lion
and the lamb lay down together in Hyde Park in a crystal
cage. But though the advent of the world-trumpeted Millennium
could not wholly fail to percolate even to Little Bradmarsh, a
more veracious chronology, a history truer to local tradition,
would date the climax of Jinny’s unmaidenly career as “before
the Flood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not, of course—as the mention of Methusalem might mislead
you into thinking—the Flood which is still commemorated in
toyshops and Babylonian tablets, and anent which German
scholars miraculously contrive to be dry; but the more momentous
local Deluge when the Brad, perversely swollen, washed
away cattle, mangold clamps, and the Holy Sabbath in one fell
surge, leaving the odd wooden gable of Frog Farm looming
above the waste of waters as nautically as Noah’s Ark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those antediluvian days, and in that sequestered hundred,
farm-horses were the ruling fauna and set the pace; the average
of which Methusalem, with his “jub” or cross between a lazy
trot and a funeral procession, did little to elevate. It was not
till the pride of life brought a giddier motion that the Flood—but
we anticipate both moral and story. Let us go rather at
the Arcadian amble of the days before the Deluge, when the
bicycle—even of the early giant order—had not yet arisen to
terrorize the countryside with its rotiferous mobility, still less
the motor-mammoth swirling through the leafy lanes in a dust-fog
and smelling like a super-skunk, or the air-monster out-soaring
and out-Sataning the broomsticked witch. It is true
that Bundock, Her Majesty’s postman, had once brought word
of a big-bellied creature, like a bloated Easter-egg, hovering over
the old maypole as if meditating to impale itself thereon, like a
bladder on a stick. But normally not even the mail or a post-chaise
divided the road with Master Bundock; while, as for the
snorting steam-horse that bore off the young Bradmarshians,
once they had ventured as far as roaring railhead, it touched the
postman’s imagination no more than the thousand-ton sea-monsters
with flapping membranes or cloud-spitting gullets that
rapt them to the lands of barbarism and gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blessèd Bundock, genial Mercury of those days before the
Flood, if the rubbered wheel of the postdiluvian age might have
better winged thy feet, yet thy susceptible eye—that rested all-embracingly
on female gleaners—was never darkened by the
sight of the soulless steel reaper, cropping close like a giant
goose, and thou wast equally spared that mechanic flail-of-all-work
that drones through the dog-days like a Brobdingnagian
bumble-bee. For thine happier ear the cottages yet hummed
with the last faint strains of the folk-song: unknown in thy
sylvan perambulations that queer metallic parrot, hoarser even
than the raucous reality, which now wakens and disenchants
every sleepy hollow with echoes of the London music-hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rural Essex was long the unchanging East, and there are still
ploughmen who watch the airmen thunder by, then plunge into
their prog again. The shepherds who pour their fleecy streams
between its hedgerows are still as primitive as the herdsmen of
Chaldea, and there are yokels who dangle sideways from their
slow beasts as broodingly as the Bedouins of Palestine. Even
to-day the spacious elm-bordered landscapes through which
Jinny’s cart rolled and her dog circumambiently darted, lie
ignored of the picture postcard, and on the red spinal chimney-shaft
of Frog Farm the doves settle with no air of perching for
their photographs. Little Bradmarsh is still Little, still the
most reclusive village of all that delectable champaign; the
Brad still glides between its willows unruffled by picnic parties
and soothed rather than disturbed by rusty, ancient barges.
But when Gran’fer Quarles first brought little Jinny to these
plashy bottoms, the region it watered—not always with discretion—was
unknown even to the gipsy caravans and strolling showmen,
and quite outside the circuit of the patterers and chaunters
who stumped the country singing or declaiming lampoons on
the early Victoria; not a day’s hard tramp from Seven Dials
where they bought their ribald broadsheets, yet as remote as
Arabia Felix.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> had rained that April more continuously than capriciously,
but this morning April showed at last her fairer face. The sunshine
held as yet no sense of heat, only the bracingness of a glad
salt wave. Across the spacious blue of the Essex sky clouds
floated and met and parted in a restful restlessness. The great
valley swam in a blue sea of vapour. Men trod as on buoyant
sunshine that bore them along. The buds were peeping out
from every hedge and tree, the blackthorn was bursting into
white, the whole world seemed like a child tiptoeing towards
some delightful future. Primroses nestled in every hollow: the
gorse lay golden on the commons. The little leaves of the trees
seemed shy, scarcely grown familiar with the fluttering of the
birds. All the misery, pain, and sadness had faded from creation
like a bad dream: the stains and pollutions were washed out,
leaving only the young clean beauty of the first day. It was a
virgin planet, fresh from the hands of its Maker, trembling with
morning dew—an earth that had never seen its own blossoming.
And the pæan of all this peace and innocence throbbed exultingly
in bird-music through all the great landscape. Over the orchard
of Frog Farm there were only two larks, but you would have
thought a whole orchestra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A blot against this background seemed the blood-red shirt of
Caleb Flynt in that same orchard; a wild undulating piece of
primeval woodland where plum-trees and pear-trees indeed
flourished, but not more so than oaks and chestnuts, briars and
brambles, or fairy mists of bluebells. The task of regenerating it
had been annually postponed, but now that Caleb was no longer
the Frog Farm “looker,” it formed, like his vegetable garden,
his wheat patch, or his wife’s piggery, a pleasant pottering-ground.
He worked without coat or smock, chastening the
ranker grass while the dew was still on it—or in his own idiom,
“while the dag was on the herb.” White-bearded and scythe-bearing,
he suggested—although the beard was short and round
and he wore a shapeless grey hat—a figure of Father Time,
incarnadined from all his wars. But in sooth no creature
breathed more at one with the earth’s mood that morning than
this ancient “Peculiar,” whose parlour bore as its text of honour—in
white letters on a lozenge of brown paper: “When He
giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quietness was, indeed, all around him in this morning freshness:
the swish of the scythe, the murmurous lapse of shorn
grass, the drone of insects, the cooing of pigeons from the cote,
the elusive cry of the new-come cuckoo, seemed forms of silence
rather than of sound. And his inner peace matched his outer,
for, as his arms automatically wielded the scythe, his soul was
actually in heaven—or at least in the New Jerusalem which,
according to his wife’s novel Christadelphian creed, was to be
let down from heaven for the virtuous remnant of earth—and at
no distant date! Not that he definitely believed in her descending
city, though he felt a certain proprietary interest in it. “Oi
don’t belong to Martha’s Church,” he reassured his brethren of
the Peculiar faith, “but Oi belongs to she and she belongs to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this mutual belonging he felt himself the brake and Martha
the spirited mare who could never stand still. No doubt her
argument that we were here to learn and to move forward was
plausible enough—how could he traverse it, he who had himself
changed from Churchman to Peculiar? But her rider: “We
don’t leave the doctrine, we carry it with us,” struck him as
somewhat shifty. And her move from “Sprinkling” to “Total
Immersion”—even if the submergence did in a sense include the
sprinkling—was surely enough progression for one lifetime. He
did not like “this gospel of gooin’ forrard”: an obstinate
instinct warned him to hold back, though with an uneasy recognition
that her ceaseless explorations of her capacious Bible—to
him a sealed book—must naturally yield discoveries denied to
his less saintly and altogether illiterate self. Discoveries indeed
had not been spared him. Ever since she had joined those new-fangled
Christadelphians—“Christy Dolphins” as he called
them—she had abounded in texts as crushing as they were
unfamiliar; and even the glib Biblical patter he had picked up
from the Peculiars was shown to imply at bottom the new
teaching. Curtain lectures are none the less tedious when they
are theological, and after a course of many months—each with
its twenty-eight to thirty-one nights—Caleb Flynt was grown
wearisomely learned in the bold doctrine launched by the great
John Thomas that “the Kingdom of God on earth” actually
meant on earth and must be brought about there and nowhere
else, and that Immortality enjoyed except in one’s terrestrial
body—however spiritualized—was as absurd a notion as that it
was lavished indiscriminately upon Tom, Giles, and Jerry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The worst of it was he could never be sure Martha was not in
the right—she had certainly modified his belief in “Sprinkling”—and
he fluttered around her “New Jerusalem” like a moth
around a lighthouse. Had anybody given a penny for his
thoughts as he stooped now over his scythe, the fortunate
investor would have come into possession of “the street of pure
gold, as it were transparent glass,” not to mention the sapphires
and emeralds, the beryls and chrysolites and all the other shining
swarms of precious stones catalogued in Revelation. If he had
kept from her the rumour that had reached his own ears of such
a treasure-city of glass actually arising in London at this very
moment, it was not because he believed this was veritably her
celestial city, but because it might possibly excite her credulity
to the pitch of wishing to see it. And the thought of a journey
was torture. Already Martha had dropped hints about the
difficulties of “upbuilding” in the lack of local Christadelphians
to institute a “Lightstand”: the wild dream of some day
breaking bread in an “Ecclesia” in London had been adumbrated:
it was possible the restless female mind even contemplated
London itself as a place to be seen before one died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But surely the New Jerusalem, if it descended at all, would—he
felt—descend here, at Little Bradmarsh. A heaven that meant
girding up one’s loins and wrenching out one’s roots was a very
problematic paradise, for all the splendour with which his inward
eye was now, despite himself, dazzled.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>From this jewelled Jerusalem Caleb was suddenly brought
back to the breathing beauty of our imperfect earth, to pear-blossom
and plum-blossom, to the sun-glinted shadows under his
trees and the mellow tiles of his roof. The sound of his own
name fell from on high—like the city of his daydream—accompanied
by a great skirring of wings, and looking up dazedly, the
pearly gates still shimmering, his eye followed the tarred side-wall
of the farmhouse till, near the roof, it lit upon his wife’s
night-capped head protruded from the tiny diamond-paned
casement that alone broke the sheer black surface of the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sense of the unusual quickened his pulses. It stole upon
him, not mainly from Martha’s face, which, despite its excited
distension, wore—over wrinkles he never saw—the same russet
complexion and was crowned by the same glory of unblanched
brown hair that had gladdened his faithful eyes since the
beginning of the century; but, more subtly and subconsciously,
through the open lattice which framed this ever-enchanting
vision. In the Flynt tradition, windows—restricted at best by
the window tax still in force—were for light, not air. Had folks
wanted air, they would have poked a hole in the wall; not built
a section of it “of transparent glass.” People so much under
the sky as Caleb and Martha Flynt had no need to invite colds
by artificial draughts. They were getting a change of air all day
long. But their rooms—their small, low-ceiled rooms—were not
thus vivified, even in their absence; the ground-floor windows
were indeed immovable, and an immemorial mustiness made a
sort of slum atmosphere in this spacious, sun-washed solitude.
Hence Caleb’s sense of a jar in his universe at the familiar, flat
pattern of the wall dislocated into a third dimension by the out-flung
casement: a prodigy which he was not surprised to find
fluttering the dovecot, and which presaged, he felt, still vaster
cataclysms. And to add to the auspices of change, he observed
another piebald pigeon among his snowy flock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear heart,” he called up, disguising his uneasiness and
shearing on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha pointed a fateful finger towards the high-hedged, oozy
path meandering beyond the orchard gate, and dividing the
sown land from the pastures sloping to the Brad. “There’s
Bundock coming up the Green Lane!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bundock?” gasped Caleb, the scythe stopping short.
“You’re a-dreamin’.” That Brother Bundock, who had been
prayed over for a decade by himself and every Peculiar in the
vicinity, should at last have taken up his bed and walked, was
too sudden a proof of their tenets, and the natural man blurted
out his disbelief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I see his red jacket,” Martha protested, “his bag on his
shoulder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ow!” His tone was divided between relief and disappointment.
“You mean Bundock’s buoy-oy!” He drew out the
word even longer than usual, and it rose even beyond the high
pitch his Essex twang habitually gave to his culminating phrases.
“Whatever can Posty be doin’ in these pa-arts?” he went on,
with a new wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the chace that squashy,” said Martha, who from her
coign of vantage could see the elderly figure labouring in the
remoter windings, “he’s sinking into it at every step.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, the mud’s only hazeled over. Whatever brings the silly
youth when the roads be in that state?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be the Census again!” groaned Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb’s brow gloomed. He feared Martha was right, and
anything official must have to do with that terrible paper-filling
which had at last by the aid of Jinny been, they had hoped,
finally accomplished some weeks before. Ever since the first
English census had been taken in the first year of the century,
Martha had been expecting a plague to fall upon the people as
it had upon the Israelites when King David numbered them.
But although she had been disappointed, there was no doubt of
the plague of the Census itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haps it’s a letter for the shepherd,” hazarded Caleb to
comfort her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’d be writing Master Peartree a letter? He can’t read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noa!” he answered complacently, for his wife’s learning
seemed part of their mutual “belonging.” The drawbacks of
this vicarious erudition were, however, revealed by his next
remark; for on Martha crying out that poor Bundock had sunk
up to his knees, Caleb bade her be easy. “He won’t be swallowed
up like that minx Cora!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martha’s motherly heart was too agitated to recognize the
Korah of her Biblical allusions—she vaguely assumed it was
some scarlet woman englutted in the slimy saltings of Caleb’s
birthplace. “Run and lead him into the right path,” she
exhorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Caleb’s brain was not one for quick reactions. Inured for
nigh seventy years to a world in which nothing happened too
suddenly, even thunderbolts giving reasonable notice and bogs
getting boggier by due degrees, he stood dazedly, his hands
paralysed on the nibs of his arrested scythe. “Happen the logs
Oi put have sunk down!” he soliloquized slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I wasn’t in my nightgown I’d go myself,” said Martha
impatiently. “ ’Tis a lesson from the Lord not to lay abed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lord allows for rheumaties, dear heart,” said Caleb
soothingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be up to his neck, if you don’t stir your stumps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not he, Martha. Unless he stands on his head.” Caleb
meant this as a literal contribution to the discussion. There
was no wilful topsy-turveydom. He was as unconscious of his
own humour as of other people’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’ll spoil his breeches anyways,” retorted Martha with
equal gravity. “And the Lord just sending his wife a new
baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bundock’s breeches be the Queen’s,” said Caleb reassuringly.
But laying down his scythe, he began to move mazedly adown
the orchard, and before the postman’s mud-cased leggings had
floundered many more rods, the veteran was sitting astride his
stile, dangling his top-boots over a rotten-planked brook, and
waving in his hairy, mahogany hand his vast red handkerchief
like a danger signal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahoy, Posty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock responded with a cheerful blast on his bugle. “Ahoy,
Uncle Flynt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn back. Don’t, ye’ll strike a bog-hole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never go back!” cried the dauntless Bundock. And even
as he spoke, his stature shrank till his bag rested on the ooze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The missus was afeared you’d spoil the Queen’s breeches,”
said Caleb sympathetically. “Catch hold of yon crab-apple
branch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better spoil her breeches than be unfaithful to her uniform,”
said the slimy hero, struggling up as directed. “I’ve got a
letter for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb’s flag fell into the brook and startled a water-rat. “A
letter for us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He splashed into the water, still dazedly, to rescue his handkerchief,
avoiding the plank as a superfluous preliminary to the
wetting; and, standing statuesque in mid-stream, more like
Father Neptune now than Father Time, he continued incredulously:
“Who’d be sendin’ us a letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not my business,” cried Bundock sternly. He came
on heroically, disregarding a posterior consciousness of damp clay,
and picking his way along the grassy, squashy strip that was
starred treacherously with peaceful daisies and buttercups, over-hung
by wild apple-trees, and hedged from the fields on either
hand by a tall, prickly tangle and congestion—as of a vegetable
slum—in which gorse, holly, speedwell, mustard, and lily of the
valley (still in green sheaths), strove for breathing space. At
the edge of a palpable mudhole he paused perforce. Caleb, who,
when he recovered from his daze at the news of the letter, had
advanced with dripping boots to meet him, was equally arrested
at the opposite frontier, and the two men now faced each other
across some fifteen feet of flowery ooze, two studies in red;
Caleb, big-limbed and stolid, in his crimson shirt, and Bundock,
dapper and peart, in his scarlet jacket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The postman’s face was lightly pockmarked, but found by
females fascinating, especially under the quasi-military cap.
Hairlessness was part of its open charm: his sun-tanned cheek
kept him juvenile despite his half-century, and preserved from
rust his consciousness of a worshipping womanhood. Caleb, on
the contrary, was all hair, little bushes growing even out of his
ears, and whiskers and beard and the silver-grey mop at his
crown running into one another without frontiers—the “Nonconformist
fringe” in a ragged edition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sow sorry to give ye sow much ill-convenience,” he called
apologetically. “Oi count,” he added, having had time for
reflection, “one of our buoy-oys has written from furrin parts.
And he wouldn’t be knowing the weather here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tain’t any of your boys,” said Bundock crossly, “because it
comes from London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a pity. The missus’ll get ’sterical when she hears
it’s for us, and it’s cruel hard to disappoint her. There ain’t
nobody else as we want letters from. Can’t you send it
back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if I can deliver it,” said Bundock stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ye can’t—unless you chuck it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slave of duty shook his head. “I daren’t risk the Queen’s
mail like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s <span class='it'>my</span> letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet, Uncle Flynt. When it reaches your hand it may
be considered safely, legally, and constitutionally delivered. But,
till then, ’tis the Queen’s letter, and don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb scratched his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If ’twas the Queen’s letter, she could read it,” he urged
obstinately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so she can,” rejoined Bundock. “She has the right to
open any letter smelling of high treason, so to speak, and nobody
can say her nay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my letter ain’t high treasony,” said Caleb indignantly.
“And if Wictoria wants to read it, why God bless her, says
Oi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock sighed before the bovinity of the illiterate mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Queen has got better things to do than read every
scribble her head’s stuck on to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happen Oi could ha’ retched it with a rake,” Caleb mused.
“What a pity you ain’t got spladges, like when Oi was a buoy-oy,
and gatherin’ pin-patches on the sands. And fine and fat they
was too when ye got ’em on the pin!” His tongue clucked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock looked his contempt. “A pretty sight, Her Majesty’s
uniform lumbering along like a winkle-picker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bide a bit then,” said Caleb, “and Oi’ll thrash through the
hedge and work through agen in your rear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a chivalrous offer, for a deep ditch barred the way to
the freshly ploughed land, and a tough and prickly chaos to the
pasture land; but Bundock declined churlishly, if not unheroically,
declaring there was a letter for Frog Cottage too.
And when Caleb, recovering from this vindication of his wife’s
prophesyings, offered to transmit it to the shepherd, “What
guarantee have I,” asked Bundock, “that it reaches him safely,
legally, and constitutionally? Nay, nay, uncle, a man must do
his own jobs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then work through the bushes yourself. Don’t, ye’ll be fit
to grow crops on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, how I hate going round—circumbendibus!” groaned
Bundock. “I might as well be driving a post-cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a mort of worser things than gooin’ round,” said
Caleb. “And Oi do be marvelling a young chap like you should
mind a bit of extra leg-work, bein’ as how ye’ve got naught else
to do but to put one leg afore the ’tother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” snapped Bundock, this ignorant summary of his
duties aggravating the moist clayey consciousness that resided
at the seat of Her Majesty’s trousers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef ye won’t keep to the high roads, you ought to git a hoss
what can clear everything,” Caleb went on to advise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And break my neck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Posty always had a hoss when I was a cad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or lay in the road with a broken back and Her Majesty’s
mail at the mercy of every tramp?” pursued Bundock. “No,
no, one cripple in a family is enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb looked pained. “You dedn’t ought to talk o’ your
feyther like that. And him pinchin’ hisself and maybe injurin’
his spinal collar to keep you at school till you was a large
buoy-oy!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock’s irritation at his Bœotian critic was suddenly diverted
by the spectacle of a female figure bearing down upon him
literally by leaps and bounds—it seemed as if the steeplechase
method recommended by Caleb was already in action. The
postman felt for his spectacles, discarded normally in the interests
of manly fascination. “Lord!” he cried. “Has your missus
joined the Jumpers?” Caleb turned his head, not unalarmed.
With so skittish a theologian anything was possible. But his
agitation subsided into a smile of admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thinks of everything,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The practical Martha was in fact advancing with an improvised
leaping-pole that had already carried her neatly over the brook
and would obviously bring Bundock over the boglet. But why—Caleb
wondered—was she risking her “bettermost” skirt? His
own mother, he remembered, had not hesitated to tuck up her
petticoats when winkles had to be gathered. And why was
Martha’s hair massed in its black net cap with a Sunday
stylishness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morning, Mrs. Flynt,” cried Bundock, becoming as genial as
the weather. Females, even sexagenarian, so long as not utterly
uncomely, turned him from an official into a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morning, Mr. Bundock!” Martha called back across the
mudhole. “I hope your father’s no worse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock’s brow clouded. Still harping on his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not so active as you,” he replied a bit testily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank the Lord!” said Caleb fervently. Then, colouring
under Bundock’s stare, “For the missus’s legs,” he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to cover his confusion he snatched the pole from her and
hurled it towards Bundock, who had barely time to jump aside
into a still squidgier patch. But in another instant the dauntless
postman secured it, and with one brave bound—like Sir Walter
Scott’s stag—had cleared the slimiest section, and his staggering,
sliding form was safely locked in Caleb’s sanguineous shirt-sleeves.
Safely but not contentedly, for at heart he was deeply
piqued at this inglorious position of Her Majesty’s envoy; the
dignified newsbearer, the beguiler of loneliness, the gossip
welcomed alike in the kitchens of the great and the parlours of
the humble. Morbidly conscious of his unpresentable rear, he
kept carefully behind the couple, while Caleb explained the
situation to Martha, breaking and blunting the news at one
hammer-blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a letter for <span class='it'>us</span>! From Lunnon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha was wonderful. “What a piece! What a master!”
he thought. One might live with a woman for half a century,
yet never fathom her depths. Not a gasp, not a cry, not a sigh
of vain yearning. Merely: “Then it’ll be from Cousin Caroline.
When she went back to London at Michaelmas she promised to
let us know if she reached home safe, and if your brother George
was better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay!” he assented happily. “Oi’d disremembered
Cousin Caroline.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a merciful oblivion, for his Cockney cousin had come
from Limehouse in August and stayed two months, protesting
that it was impossible to bide a day in a place where there wasn’t
a neighbour to speak to except a silly shepherd who was never
at home; where water was scooped filthily from a green-scummy
pond instead of flowing naturally from a tap; where on moonless
nights you could break your leg at your own doorstep; where
frogs croaked and cocks crowed and pigeons moaned and foxes
barked at the unholiest hours; where disgusting vermin were
nailed on the trees and where you broke out in itching blotches,
which folks might ascribe to “harvesters,” but which were
susceptible of a more domestic explanation. Moreover, Cousin
Caroline had brought a profuse and uninvited progeny, whose
unexpected appearance in Jinny’s cart, though vaguely comforting
as recalling the days when the house resounded with
child-life, was in truth at disturbing discord with the Quakerish
calm into which Frog Farm had subsided after the flight of its
teeming chicks. As Caleb came along now, convoying Bundock
through the lush orchard grass, the echo of Cousin Caroline’s
querulous voice rasped his brain and made him wish she had
pretermitted her promise to write. As for his ailing brother
George, information about whom she was probably sending, it
was obvious that he was no worse, else one would assuredly have
heard of his funeral. Had not George carefully let him know
when he got married? Caroline was a Churchwoman—he
remembered suddenly—she had compromised Frog Farm by
eking out Parson Fallow’s miserable congregation. And now
she had sent her letter just at a season to plague and muddy
a worthy Dissenter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sow sorry to give ye sow much ill-convenience, Mr. Bundock,”
he repeated, as they reached the farmhouse.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Frog Farm, before which Bundock stood fumbling in his bag,
was—as its name implies—situated in a batrachian region,
croakily cheerless under a sullen sky, a region revealed under the
plough as ancient sedge-land, black with rotted flags and rushes.
But the scene was redeemed at its worst by the misty magnificence
of great spaces, whose gentle undulations could not
counteract a sublime flatness; not to mention the beauty of the
Brad gliding like the snake in the grass it sometimes proved.
The pasture land behind the farmhouse and sloping softly down
to the river—across which, protected by a dyke and drained by
little black mills working turbine wheels, lay the still lower Long
Bradmarsh—was the salvage of a swamp roughly provided with
a few, far-parted drains by some pioneer squatter, content—on
the higher ground where a farmhouse was possible—to fell and
slice his own timber and bake his own tiles. At the topmost
rim, on a road artificially raised to take its wagons to the higher
ground or “Ridge” of the village, rose this farmhouse with its
buildings, all dyked off from the converted marsh by a three-foot
wall of trunk-fragments and uncouth stones, bordered by
bushes. The house turned its back on the Brad, and had not
even hind eyes to see it—another effect of the window tax—and
had the rear of the house not been relieved by the quaint red
chimney bisecting it, the blankness would have been unbearable.
But if little of good could have been said of its architecture
behind its back, and if even in front it ended abruptly at one
extremity like a sheer cliff or a halved haystack, with one gable
crying for another to make both ends meet, it was as a whole
picturesque enough with all that charm of rough wood, which
still seems to keep its life-sap, and beside which your marble hall
is a mere petrifaction. Weather-boarded and tarred, it faced
you with a black beauty of its own, amid which its diamond-paned
little lattices gleamed like an Ethiopian’s eyes. In the
foreground, haystacks, cornricks, and strawstacks gave grace and
colour, fusing with the spacious landscape as naturally as the
barns and byres and storehouses, the troughs and stables and
cart-sheds and the mellow, immemorial dung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what surprised the stranger more than its lop-sidedness was
the duplication of its front door, for there were two little doors,
with twin sills and latches. It had, in fact, been partitioned
to allow a couple of rooms to the shepherd-cowman, when that
lone widower’s cottage was needed for an extra horseman.
Master Peartree’s new home became known as Frog Cottage.
The property was what was here called an “off-hand farm,” the
owner being “in parts,” or engaged in other enterprises, and for
more than a generation Caleb Flynt had lived there as “looker”
to old Farmer Gale, the cute Cornish invader who had discovered
the fatness of the oozy soil, and who had been glad to install a
son of it as a reconciling link between Little Bradmarsh and
“the furriner.” Caleb belonged to that almost extinct species
of managers who can dispense with reading and writing, and his
semi-absentee employer found his honesty as meticulous as his
memory. While the Flynt nestlings were growing up, the
parent birds had found the nest a tight fit, but with the gradual
flight of the brood to every quarter of the compass, the old pair
had receded into its snugger recesses—living mainly by the
kitchen fire under the hanging hams. Thus when last year
Farmer Gale’s son, succeeding to the property and foolishly
desiring a more scientific and literate bailiff, delicately intimated
that having bought all the adjoining land, he had been compelled
to acquire therewith the rival looker, the old Flynts were glad
enough to be allowed for a small rent the life-use of the farmhouse
and the bits of waste land around it, subject to their providing
living room for old Master Peartree, who was to pasture his flock
of sheep and a few kine in the near meadows. Martha, indeed,
always maintained that Caleb had made a bad bargain with the
new master—did not the whole neighbourhood pronounce the
young widower a skinflint?—but Caleb, who had magisterially
negotiated with the new bailiff the swapping of his wood-ashes
for straw for her pet pig, Maria, limited his discussions with her
to theology. “When one talks law and high business,” he
maintained, “we must goo back to the days afore Eve was dug
out of Adam.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock, restored to his superiority by the deprecatory
expectancy of the old couple, observed graciously that there was
no need to apologize: anybody was liable to have a letter.
Indeed, he added generously, with nine boys dotted about the
world, Frog Farm might have been far more troublesome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eleven, Mr. Bundock,” corrected Martha with a quiver in
her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t reckon the dead and buried, Mrs. Flynt. They don’t
write—not even to the dead-letter office.” He cut short a
chuckle, remembering this was no laughing matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the other nine might as well be dead for all the letters
you bring me,” Martha retorted bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No news is good news, dear heart,” Caleb put in, as though
to shield the postman. He was not so sure now that this unfortunate
letter had not disturbed her slowly won resignation.
“We’ve always yeared of anything unpleasant—like when
Daniel married the Kaffir lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was Christopher,” said Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ow, ay, Christopher. ’Tis a wonder he could take to a
thick-lipped lady. Oi couldn’t fancy a black-skinned woman,
even if she was the Queen of Sheba. Oi shook hands with one
once, though, and it felt soft. They rub theirselves with oil to
keep theirselves lithe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha replied only with a sigh. The Kaffir lady, for all her
coloured and heathen horror, at least supplied a nucleus for
visualization, whereas all her other stalwart sons, together with
one married daughter, had vanished into the four corners of the
Empire—building it up with an unconsciousness mightier than
the sword—and only the children who had died young—two girls
and a boy—remained securely hers, fixed against the flux of life
and adventure. Occasionally indeed an indirect rumour of her
live sons’ doings came to her, but correspondence was not the
habit of those days when even amid the wealthier classes a boy
might go out to India and his safe arrival remain unknown for a
semestrium or more. The foreign postage, too, was no inconsiderable
check to the literary impulse or encouragement to the
lazy. Indeed postage stamps were still confined to half a dozen
countries. It was but a decade since they had come in at all
and letters with envelopes or an extra sheet had ceased to be
“double”; postcards were still unknown, and in many parts
postmen came as infrequently as carriers, people often hastening to
scrawl replies which the same men might convey to the mail-bags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kaffirs ain’t black,” corrected Bundock. “They’re coffee-coloured.
That’s what the name means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha sighed again. So far had her brooding fantasy gone
that she sometimes pictured baby grandchildren as innocently
dusky as the hybrid young fantails which no solicitude could
keep out of her dovecot, and which were a reminder that heaven
knew no colour-boundaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be nervous,” Bundock reassured her. “I’ll find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no hurry, no hurry!” said Caleb, beginning to perspire
distressingly under the postman’s exertions and to mop his hairy
brow with his brook-sopped handkerchief. How these youngsters
grew up! he was thinking. Brats one had seen spanked waxed
into mighty officers of State. “Shall I brush your breeches,
Posty?” he inquired tactlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use till they’re dry?” snapped Bundock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in and dry them before the kitchen fire,” said Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This sun’ll dry them,” he said coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so slick as the fire,” Caleb blundered on. “ ’Tain’t like
you was a serpent walking on your belly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock flushed angrily and right-wheeled to hide the seat of
his trousers. “Why you should go and catch your letter when
the roads are in that state——!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could ha’ waited till they dried!” Caleb said deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did wait a post-day or so,” said Bundock with undiminished
resentment. “But there’s such a thing, uncle, as duty to my
Queen. Things might have got damper instead of drier, like the
time the floods were out beyond Long Bradmarsh, and I might
have had to swim out to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb was impressed. “But <span class='it'>can</span> you swim?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not the point,” growled Bundock. “I don’t say I’d
ha’ faced the elements for <span class='it'>you</span>, but if somebody with real traffic
and entanglement were living here, e.g. the Duke of Wellington,
I should have come through fire and water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Dook at a farm!” Caleb smiled incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Battle of Waterloo,” said Bundock icily, “the whole
fight was whether he or Boney should hold a farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say!” cried Caleb excitedly. “And who got it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it wasn’t Froggy’s Farm.” And Bundock roared with
glee and renewed self-respect. Caleb guffawed too, but merely
for elation at the Frenchy’s defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The calm and piping voice of Martha broke in upon this
robustious duet, pointing out that there was no Duke in residence
and no need for natation, but that since Jinny called for orders
every Friday he might have given <span class='it'>her</span> the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give the Queen’s mail to a girl!” Bundock looked
apoplectic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny never loses anything,” said Martha, unimpressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll lose her character if she ain’t careful,” he said viciously;
“driving of a Sunday with Farmer Gale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s onny to chapel,” said Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man that rich’ll never take her there!” sneered Bundock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Jinny’s only a child,” said Martha, roused at last. “And
the best girl breathing. Look how she slaves for her grandfather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny! Jinny!” Bundock muttered. “Nothing but Jinny
all the day and all the way.” How often indeed had she snatched
the gossip from his mouth, staled his earth-shaking tidings, even
as the Bellman anticipated his jokes! “Let me catch her carrying
letters, that’s all. I’ll have the law on her, child or no child.
I expect she blows that horn to make the old folks think she’s
got postal rights!” He did not mention that in his vendetta
against the girl it was he who never hesitated to poach on the
rival preserves, and that he was even now carrying a certain
packet of tracts which he had found at “The Black Sheep”
awaiting Jinny’s day, and which he had bagged on the ground
that he had a letter for the same address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny would have saved your legs,” said Martha dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb turned on her. “Ay, and his leggings too!” he burst
forth with savage sarcasm. But at great moments deep calls to
deep. “Women don’t understand a man’s duty. And Posty’s
every inch a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock tried to look his full manhood: fortunately the discovery
of the letter at this instant enabled him to gain an inch
or two by throwing back his shoulders, so long bent under the
royal yoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mrs.</span> Flynt,” he announced majestically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For <span class='it'>me</span>?” gasped Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For you,” said Bundock implacably. “Mrs. Flynt, Frog
Farm, Swash End, Little Bradmarsh, near Chipstone, Essex. Not
that I hold it’s proper to write to a man’s wife while he’s alive—but
<span class='it'>my</span> feelings don’t count.” And he tendered her the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does seem more becoming for Flynt to have his Cousin
Caroline’s letter,” admitted Martha, shrinking back meekly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock relaxed in beams. “I’m wonderfully pleased with
you, Mrs. Flynt,” he said, handing Caleb the letter. “You’re a
shining example, for all you stand up for that chit. When I
think of Deacon Mawhood’s wife and how she defies him with
that bonnet of hers——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of bonnet?” said Martha, pricking up her ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t heard?” Bundock’s satisfaction increased.
“It’s like the Queen’s—drat her! I mean, drat Mrs. Mawhood—made
with that new plait—‘Brilliant’s’ the name. They turn
the border of one edge of the straw inwards and that makes it
all splendiferous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pomps and wanities,” groaned Caleb. “And she a deacon’s
wife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock sniggered. <span class='it'>His</span> sympathy with the husband was
deeper and older than theology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you,” Martha reminded Caleb, “what would come of
electing a ratcatcher a deacon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A righteous ratcatcher,” maintained Caleb sturdily, “be
higher than a hungodly emperor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t got any emperors,” said the practical Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how many kings have joined your Ecclesia?” put in
Bundock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the kings of righteousness!” answered Martha in trumpet-tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock was quelled. “Well, I can’t stop gammicking,” he
said, shouldering his bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you have a glass of pagles wine?” said Martha,
relapsing to earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you. I’ve got a letter for Frog Cottage
too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Master Peartree!” cried Martha. “And all in one
morning. Well, if that’s not a miracle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and your miracles!” he said with a Tom Paine brutality.
“Why I saved up yours till another came for Swash End. And
so I’ve managed to kill——” His face suddenly changed. The
brutal look turned beatific. But his sentence was frozen. The
good couple regarded him dubiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s amiss?” cried Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock gasped for expression like a salmon on a slab. “To
kill” burst from his lips again, but the rest was choked in a
spasm of cachinnation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll kill yourself laughin’,” said Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock mastered himself with a mighty effort. “So as to
kill—ha, ha, ha!—to kill—ha, ha, ha!—two frogs—ha, ha, ha!—with
one stone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha corrected him coldly: “Two birds, you mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay,” corroborated Caleb, “the proverb be two birds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But here,” Bundock explained between two convulsions,
“it’s two <span class='it'>frogs</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb shook his head. “Oi’ve lived here or by the saltings
afore you was born, and brought up a mort o’ childer here. Two
birds, sonny, two birds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock’s closing chuckles died into ineffable contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning,” he said firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure you won’t have a sip o’ pagles wine?” repeated
Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head sternly. “If I had time for drinking I’d
have time to tell you all the news.” He turned on his heel,
presenting the post-bag at them like a symbol of duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything fresh?” murmured Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock veered round viciously. “D’you suppose all Bradmarsh
is as sleepy as the Froggeries? Fresh? Why, there’s
things as fresh as the thatch on Farmer Gale’s barn or the paint
on Elijah Skindle’s new dog-hospital or the black band on the
chimney-sweep’s Sunday hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Mrs. Whitefoot dead?” inquired Martha anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ’twas only his mother-in-law in London, and when he
went up to the funeral he had his pocket picked. Quite spoilt
his day, I reckon—ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buryin’ ain’t a laughin’ matter,” rebuked Caleb stolidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It depends who’s buried,” said Bundock. “I shouldn’t cry
over Mrs. Mawhood. Which reminds me that the Deacon sent
out the Bellman to say he couldn’t be responsible for her debts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried Caleb. Martha paled, but was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only the Bellman spoilt it as usual with his silly old jokes.
Proclaimed that the Deacon had put his foot down on his wife’s
bonnet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He, he, he!” laughed the old couple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock turned a hopeless hump. “<span class='it'>Good</span> morning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thank you kindly for the letter,” called Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t mention it,” said Bundock. “And besides I killed—ho,
ho, ho!—two frogs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They heard his explosions on the quiet air long after he and
his royal hump had vanished along the Bradmarsh road.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb’s eyes followed the heaving mail-bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bundock’s buoy-oy fares to be jolly this mornin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does be lively sometimes,” agreed Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Caleb became aware of the letter in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dash my buttons, Martha! We disremembered to ask him
to read it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It can no longer be concealed that despite her erudition
Martha could not read writing nor write save by imitating
print. The cursive alphabet was Phœnician to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t forget,” she answered with her masterly calm.
“Bundock’s too leaky. You heard him tell all the gossip and
scandal. And it ain’t true about Jinny, for Master Peartree saw
them riding in the other Sunday and Farmer Gale’s little boy
sat between them. Besides, Bundock’s a man, and I don’t want
a man to read my letter from Caroline.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The point seemed arguable, but Caleb meekly suggested
the little boy she had just mentioned—only a mile and a half
away. He would be at school, Martha pointed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb looked at the letter as a knifeless cook at an oyster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the clock-time?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite certain. I set the clock by Jinny last Friday, but
it stopped suddenly yesterday, when I was reading you St. Paul’s
Epistle to the Corinthians. Haven’t you heard it not striking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afeared Oi’m gooin’ deafish, dear heart. But we’ll know
the clock-time on Friday,” he added philosophically. “And
when Jinny comes she can read the letter likewise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martha was blushing. “No, no, not Jinny! She’s a
young girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank the Lord for her lively face!” agreed Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe she oughtn’t to read a letter to a married woman,”
explained Martha shyly, “being a girl without mother or sisters,
brought up by her grandfather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Cousin Caroline wouldn’t write naught improper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not—but it mightn’t be proper for an orphan girl
to read. Maybe it’s not even proper for you, and that’s why she
addressed it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb felt as bemused as before a Bundock witticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joulterhead!” said Martha, with a loving smile. “And
you’ve had fourteen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter fell from his nerveless fingers. “Cousin Caroline
confined again!” And the clacking of all those innumerable
infants filled the air—like the barking of the black geese on the
wintry mud-flats. But he recovered himself. “Why, she’s a
widow, not a pair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Widows can be re-paired,” said Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must have been a middlin’ bold man to goo courtin’ a family
that size,” Caleb reflected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up the letter and poised it in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t feel as weighty as St. Paul’s letters,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The text doesn’t mean his letters were heavy,” explained
Martha. “ ‘His letters, say they, are weighty and powerful’—that’s
what I was reading you when the clock stopped. Any
fool can write a heavy letter—he’s only got to write on a slate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a true word,” said Caleb, admiring her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whereas,” pursued Martha, “the whole Bible has been got
inside a nutshell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord!” said Caleb. “I suppose it was a cokernut!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. Only a walnut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy! But was there walnuts in the Holy Land?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say ’twas done in Palestine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there wasn’t walnuts there?” His face fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t remember—oh, yes—Solomon asked his love to come
into the garden of nuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it don’t say walnuts?” he inquired wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say it does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then maybe there won’t be pickled walnuts in the New
Jerusalem?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not all the righteous have your carnal appetite,” said Martha
severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You just said Solomon’s sweetheart liked nuts,” said Caleb
stoutly. “And dedn’t the Holy Land flow with milk and
honey?” He had a vision of it, seamed and riddled like his
native mud-flat, but with lacteal creeks and mellifluous pools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You put me out so,” snapped Bundock, suddenly reappearing
before the engrossed couple, “that I forgot to kill my two frogs
after all!” And going to the Frog Cottage doorway, he knocked
officially before opening it and committing the letter to the
empty interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be witness that I delivered it constitutionally,” he
said, “for I can’t be expected to come a third time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis a windfall your coming a second,” cried Caleb eagerly,
“bein’ as we can’t read the letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha made facial contortions to remind him that Bundock
was barred. “ ’Tain’t you we want to read it,” he hurriedly
added, “but when a letter comes all of an onplunge, time a man’s
peacefully trimmin’ the werges, he ain’t prepared like. You
haven’t got a moment—did, Oi’d be glad o’ your counsel on the
matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, since I’ve wasted so much of the Queen’s time——!”
said Bundock, flattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They adjourned to the parlour to give him a rest, and denuding
himself of both cap and bag of office, he occupied oracularly the
long-unused arm-chair, while Caleb, uncomfortably perched on a
seat of slippery horsehair, started to unfold the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take off your hat,” broke in Martha. “Mr. Bundock will
be thinking you’ve no manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll be soon gooin’ outside again,” said Caleb obstinately,
and re-started his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do let me explain,” interrupted Martha at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do let me get a word in,” cried Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, take off your hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll be gooin’ outside soon, Oi tell ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you can put it on again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi shall never make Bundock sensible, ef you keep interruptin’
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Mr. Bundock, it’s this way——” began Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ve told him all that,” said Caleb. “Let <span class='it'>me</span> speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, take off your hat,” said Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll be gooin’ outside agen, won’t Oi?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock was examining the letter which had been laid on the
table as for an operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it don’t look like a woman’s writing,” he interrupted.
“That would be spidery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tain’t likely she could write herself in that condition,” began
Caleb, but Martha’s face again hushed him down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s neither seal nor sticking envelope,” pursued the
expert. “Nothing but a wafer. Comes from a poor man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her new husband,” said Caleb, and set Martha grimacing
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll be soon gooin’ outside,” he protested, misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you want,” summed up Bundock judicially, “is a
mixture of discretion with matrimony, seasoned with a sprinkle
of learning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He talks like the Book!” said Caleb admiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where <span class='it'>is</span> this mixture?” inquired Martha eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She don’t exist,” said Bundock. “But Miss Gentry is the
nearest lady that can read, and Fate is just sending me with a
letter and a packet to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The couple looked doubtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ain’t matrimony,” said Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” admitted Bundock, “but I guess she’s old enough to
be, though I haven’t seen her census paper—he, he! And besides
she’s a dressmaker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that to do with it?” asked Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see your missus understands,” said Bundock mysteriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she won’t walk five miles to read my letter,” urged
the blushing Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb had one of the great inspirations of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And ain’t it time you got a new gownd?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha flushed up. “Oh, Caleb! Don’t let us run to
vanity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wanity, mother! It ain’t tinkling ornaments nor cauls nor
nose-jewels,” protested Caleb, with a vague reminiscence of her
Biblical readings. “And ye’ve had naught since the sucking-pig
Oi bought ye for your sixtieth birthday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martha shook her head, quoting firmly:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why not a bonnet?” suggested Bundock. “That
would be cheaper than a gown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, a bonnet!” agreed Caleb, though he sounded it a
“boarnt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha flashed a resentful glance which, however, Bundock
took for but another thrust at Caleb’s obstinate hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want a new bonnet,” she cried indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It needn’t be new,” said Bundock helpfully. “Just have
your old bonnet whitened. That’s on her bill-paper:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good notion,” said Caleb. “You don’t want it
bran-span-new. Posty’ll tell her to come over here to get your
old boarnt and then we’ll spring Cousin Caroline’s letter on
her for her to read!” He chuckled. Bundock chuckled too,
swelling at the adoption of his advice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now that I’ve stopped gammicking so long, I may as well
sample that cowslip wine, Mrs. Flynt,” he observed graciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martha had vanished.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry had apartments in one of the most elegant
cottages to be found in Little Bradmarsh. Protected by palings,
it stood all alone on the high road, painted a vivid green, with
three pollarded lime-trees in front like sentinel mops. At the
base of the trim little garden the front door rose above two
wooden steps with a little porch and ostentated a brass plate
with the inscription:</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Miss Gentry</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Late of Colchester</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Practical Dressmaker and Milliner.</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>In proof of which, from the cottage window, whose green shutters
lay folded back, a <span class='it'>visite</span> or jacket of black silk, and a polka
jacket, and a trio of straw bonnets, Tuscan or Leghorn, appealed
to the passing eye: one of them a bonnet cap with a quilting of
net and broad blue strings, another resplendent with purple
ribbons and the new-treated straw plait that the Queen and
Mrs. Mawhood favoured, and the third of drawn silk on little
wires. The pictures of the period with a wonderful unanimity
and monotony display a single style of bonnet, but artists in
those days were men, and Miss Gentry could have told you
better. “I’ve looked down from a pew in the gallery of my Colchester
Church on Easter Sunday,” she told Jinny once, “and
tried in vain to find two fellow-bonnets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her professional door with its immaculate paint and shining
brass was so forbiddingly respectable that clients mostly preferred
to seek access through her landlady’s back door, where the
flutter of washing from the clothes-line on its green square poles
in the little orchard was reassuring; not to mention her chickens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Practical” was the unfailing adjective in those parts. Miss
Gentry was not undeserving of it, for her dresses were cheap
without being vulgar, while her knack of whitening the straw
enabled the poorest, in the succession of new bonnets, to keep
pace with Victoria on the throne. A stranger might have
thought another species of dressmaker existed, whose confections,
though exquisite, would never fit, or who designed, but could not
execute; whereas the only other person for miles round at all
in the sartorial line was an equally “Practical Breeches-Maker,”
placarding from a flower-potted cottage window his “Strong,
Stylish Pantaloons.” But the thought of <span class='it'>un</span>practical pantaloons—say,
without buttons or belts—or of theoretical trousers, was
simple compared with the image evoked by Mr. Henry Whitefoot’s
door-plate, proclaiming that victim of the London pick-pocket
a “Practical Chimney-Sweep”: as by contrast with
some exquisite dream Ethiopian, only platonically black, darkly
revolving flues and fireplaces, sweeping shadow-chimneys with
fleckless brushes, and carrying off ideal bags of the soot that
never was on sea or land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps in Miss Gentry’s case the word “Practical” was
necessary to offset the business-damage of the tradition that had
followed her from her native Colchester. For Miss Gentry had
had a “revelation.” It had occurred in her girlhood, but the
halo of it still circled round her chignon. Seated in church, full
of worldly thoughts—possibly studying the infinite variety of
bonnets—she had seen the stained-glass angel move. What this
flutter of wing and lifting of leg “revealed” had never been
clear: unless—as a wag maintained—it portended the flight of
Miss Gentry herself. That hegira of hers from Colchester to
Bradmarsh had not, alas, increased her prophetic prestige: what
right has a “furriner” to come with “revelations”? Even her
fellow-Churchfolk—she was one of the few Bradmarshians that
clung to the Establishment—looked askance on the miracle,
feeling it indeed as reprehensibly Papish, and as lending colour to
the suspicion that she was a “French” dressmaker: a suspicion
strengthened at once by her elegant handiwork, and by her full-bosomed
plenitude, swarthy complexion, and more than embryonic
moustache. It was forgotten that if these did imply
Gallic blood, it would have been, not the Papish, but that Huguenot
strain whose inpour into the county had at one time carried
the French liturgy into Essex churches. As a matter of fact
Miss Gentry was so fanatical a Church woman that she supplemented
all her bills and receipts by tracts in defence of the
Establishment, purchased at her own expense from a mysterious
reservoir in Colchester. Nevertheless, such is the contrariety of
mankind, the large accession she represented to the parish
church—where on wet Sundays only the Apostle’s two or three
were gathered together—was discounted by her felt queerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was, still more oddly, from the Peculiars that she
received the bulk of her custom, and this despite her top-lofty
airs towards them, and the tracts suggesting that souls, no
less than bonnets, could be bleached as good as new. Possibly
their more elastic spirituality vibrated more readily to the
moving angel: perhaps the real bond of sympathy was that they
knew her unpopular with the Church: like themselves a butt of
legend, and lacking even their advantage of Bradmarsh birth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even the Churchwomen did not utterly deny patronage
to this talented needlewoman, nor refuse her the deference due
to weekday gloves, a parasol, and bills with printed headlines;
they did not even discountenance her crusade against Dissent,
though her copious allusions to Providence “moving in a
mysterious way” were felt to be too broadly autobiographic.
Moreover, in view of the caustic remarks upon cardinals,
Puseyites, black-robed priests, and winking pictures, by which
her tracts began to diversify the attack upon Dissent—for John
Bull was getting alarmed at the new Roman invasion—it was a
source of surprise that she failed to see the beam in her own
eye. For if Virgins could not wink in Rimini, why should
Angels wobble in Colchester? To add to her oddity, her brain
was full of ancient maggots of astrology and medicine, crept in
from “Culpeper’s Herbal,” her one bedside book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Bundock should be bringing a bonnet commission to this
excellent and industrious, if freakish female, was the more laudable,
inasmuch as he nourished a prejudice against her and her
tracts. Not that he held with Catholic or evangelical Dissenters
any more than with the Church proper. As a follower of Tom
Paine, whose “Age of Reason” he read piously in bed every Sunday
morning—the passage asserting that to make a true miracle
Jonah should have swallowed the whale was a regular Lesson—he
regarded himself as a great free spirit in an illiterate and
priest-ridden world, one whose God was everywhere except in
Church. Not that he could follow the Master’s excursions into
trigonometry or astronomy or knew anything of his idol’s
“Rights of Man,” being indeed singularly free from the contemporary
unrest of the industrial townsman, and combining,
like greater men, a crusty conservatism for the old order with a
radical rejection of its spinal creed. Possibly his devotion to
the still youthful Queen was part of his softness for the sex, for
the only part of “The Age of Reason” that left him unconvinced
was its impugnment of the wisdom of Solomon, its contention
that “seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines are
worse than none.” But it was not Tom Paine, nor even Bob
Taylor’s “The Devil’s Chaplain,” it was the long years of his
father’s paralysis that had first sapped his faith in the pharmacopœian
aspects of prayer, though he considerately concealed
his defection from his bed-ridden parent, and even the visiting
elders withheld the racking information. The old Bundock was
not, however, to be deceived, on this point at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son is moral, only moral,” he would say, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To such a temperament Miss Gentry must needs be antipathetic,
and to mark his distaste, Bundock was wont to leave
the Colchester packets of tracts as well as the “practical”
correspondence at the side door, shedding the light of his countenance
only on the landlady. But on this occasion, having a
message to deliver as well as a missive and a packet, he performed
resoundingly on the green knocker, and Miss Gentry herself,
attended by Squibs, her ebony cat, appeared in the narrow, little
passage, frenziedly stitching at a feminine fabric. Behind her,
through the open back door, was a gleam of blossoming orchard
and dangling chemises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Bundock,” she said graciously; “lovely
weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right overhead,” he grumbled, “but underfoot,
especially at Frog Farm—whew!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had to go to Frog Farm?” she inquired sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but there was a letter for Frog Cottage too. So I—he,
he!—I killed two frogs with one stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two birds, you mean,” said Miss Gentry, embosoming her
letter with a romantic air and laying her packet on a chair.
She added in alarm: “Would you like a glass of water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t need drink,” said Bundock, mastering the apoplectic
assault, “it’s other folks that need brains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My, were the old Flynts unusually trying?” she asked
sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They want you to clean the gammer’s bonnet,” he answered
brusquely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not so foolish.” Her needle was moving busily again.
“Have you brought it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That does seem foolish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not a bonnet-bearer! They want <span class='it'>you</span> to fetch it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! Five miles to clean a bonnet! When I’m so busy!
And in all that mud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t so muddy this side o’ Swash End, and it’s not two
miles each way by the fields.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, with horrid cows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock felt protective. “Cows ain’t bulls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I won’t go. You tell Mrs. Flynt she must come to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I tell her? I shan’t likely be going that way for
months, thank my stars.” Miss Gentry quivered a little at the
expression, wondering under what planet he was born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll write to her,” she said conclusively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! And me take the letter!” In his indignation he
almost blurted out that the same difficulty of reading it would
arise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll tell Jinny to bring the bonnet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock felt baffled. Instead of cunningly helping the Flynts
to get their letter read, he had only secured that minx of a
carrier a commission. He scowled at the dressmaker, seeing her
moustache as big as a guardsman’s and believing the worst of
the legends about it: even that the real reason she left Colchester
was that the bristly-bearded oysterman to whom she was engaged
had refused to shave unless <span class='it'>she</span> did. “I’ll be wishing you a
good morning,” he said icily, hitching up his bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning,” said Miss Gentry. But she omitted to slam
the door in his face as he expected, indeed she had gradually
advanced into the porch, stitching unrelaxingly. And Bundock
now became acutely aware that he could not turn his back on
her without revealing the stain on Her Majesty’s uniform, that
even by lowering the mail-bag he had just hitched up, he could
not cover up what certain rude ploughboys had already commented
on. He understood it was green. In this dreadful
situation he began backing slowly as from the presence of
royalty, making desperate conversation to cover his retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did give you your tracts, didn’t I?” he babbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you mean the packet,” said Miss Gentry in stern rebuke,
“there it lies. <span class='it'>I</span> haven’t opened it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that <span class='it'>I</span> have?” he asked indignantly, gaining
another yard in this rear-guard action. “We don’t have to open
an oyster to know what’s inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry’s brow grew as swarthy as her moustache—at the
reminder of her lost oysterman, Bundock supposed in dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you always send out tracts after I bring you packets?”
he explained hastily, still retreating with his face to the foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not when they’re patterns,” said Miss Gentry crushingly.
“And how do you know it’s not <span class='it'>The Englishwomen’s Magazine</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned back into the passage, and he hoped she would
slam the door on her triumph, but she took up the packet instead.
“We shall soon see,” and snipping the string with mysteriously
produced scissors, she read out unctuously: “Ishmael and the
Wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock did not know which way to turn. Why in the name
of propriety did she not go back to her workroom and close her
door? Miss Gentry, without the clue to his lingering attitude,
observed invitingly, tapping the packet: “If this won’t make
you see the beauties of the Establishment, nothing will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grinned uncomfortably. “Always willing to see the
beauties of any establishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very strange. Give him a female, even with a moustache,
even tepefied by tracts, and something from the deeps
rose up to philander. Not that there wanted a lurid fascination
in this exotic and literate lady: his very loathing was a tribute
to a vivid personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry, however, was shocked. She put down the tracts.
She knew herself “born under Venus,” but romance and respectability
were never disjoined in her day-dreams, and as the
channel of a revelation she felt profaned. “Don’t talk like
that,” she said sharply. “You’re a married man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis a married man knows how to appreciate beauty,” he
replied, receding farther nevertheless as in ironic commentary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For shame!” Her needle stabbed on. “And you setting
up to be holy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me?” Surprise brought his strategic retreat to a standstill.
“I never set up to be a stained-glass saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he had blundered. The black eyes flashed fire. “You
who move mountains!” she cried angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me move mountains?” Bundock was bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little grain of mustard-seed,” he heard her saying more
tremulously. “And if a sycamine-tree could move—! Surely
you don’t hold with the unbelievers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was precisely whom Bundock did hold with, but the big
black eyes seemed suddenly tearful and appealing, her needle
seemed entering his breast, and she swam before him as a fine,
voluptuous female. Through the passage he saw the apple-trees
in bridal bloom and the white feminine washing, and the Master’s
remark on the apparent miracle of the extraction of electric
flashes from the human body thrilled in his memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” he heard himself saying soothingly, while his
legs felt going forward, losing all the ground so laboriously won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you do believe the angel moved?” she asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I see her moving?” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry looked down from her doorstep more in sorrow
than in anger. “You’re a married man!” she reminded him
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does marriage pick out a man’s eyes—like a goat-sucker?”
He felt too near her now to back out, and he put
forth his hand for hers, not without nervousness at the needle.
Could his father have seen him now, he might have thought his
son not even “moral.” But Miss Gentry dexterously met the
amorous palm with a tract. “That’ll open your eyes,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To feel a flabby piece of paper instead of a warm hand is not
conducive to theological persuasion: all Bundock’s dissenting
blood rushed to his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s two opinions about that,” he snorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There <span class='it'>are</span> two opinions,” Miss Gentry assented placidly;
“one wrong and the other mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course!” he sneered. “The Church is always infallible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re eighteen and a half centuries old,” said Miss Gentry
freezingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you put that in your census paper?” retorted the
humorist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry winced. She was weary of the jokes that had
desolated Bradmarsh, yet she was conscious of having let her
landlady’s estimate of her age go by default.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had no paper to fill up,” she reminded him frigidly. “But
if there was a census of religions, you’d certainly be among the
mushrooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better than being among the mummies.” Bundock’s father
might have clapped his palsied hands, to hear this defender of
the faith. But Miss Gentry mistook this fair retort in kind for
another allusion to the personal census.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you could discuss like a gentleman!” It was a
cunning shaft, and Squibs, seizing this moment to rub herself
against the postman’s leggings, he replied more mildly: “What’s
the use of going by age—except the Age of Reason?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then be guided by Reason.” Miss Gentry stitched implacably.
“If the Almighty meant prayer to be medicine, why did
He create castor-oil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock was dumbfounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or Epsom salts?” she added triumphantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re for cattle which can’t pray,” he answered with an
inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry’s needle stabbed the air. But she recovered
herself. “Then why do you eat rhubarb pie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it’s nice.” He grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But rhubarb’s a medicine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He countered cleverly. “We don’t mind taking medicine—so
long as we’re well!” We! He was identifying himself with his
despised Brethren: such is human nature under attack. But
Miss Gentry was not at the end of her resources.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you do when you break your legs? Pray the
bones straight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we don’t break our legs. I never heard of a Peculiar
breaking his leg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why shouldn’t a Peculiar break his leg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not my affair. He don’t. I’ve got Peculiars all over
my beat, and never have I known one to break a leg. A broken
heart, now——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if he <span class='it'>did</span> break a leg?” persisted Miss Gentry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If any one could break a leg, it would be me!” he said
crossly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then what would <span class='it'>you</span> do—if you broke your leg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock was worn out. “What’s the good of meeting
troubles half-way?” he snapped, turning on his heel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yours seem to have come more than half-way,” scoffed Miss
Gentry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock clapped his hand to the mud-patch, stung in his
tenderest part. He wheeled round prestissimo, raging with
repartee. But the door had closed—too late! Solitary, the
sable Squibs dominated the doorstep—like a sardonic spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock was turning away angrily, though now fearlessly,
when with a sudden thought he caught up the cat and plucked
out one of her hairs. It was not revenge—it was merely that his
youngest daughter had a sty, for which he believed the black
hair an infallible remedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Thus</span> it was that the days passed without any literate and
discreet female descending on Frog Farm or any rejuvenation
appearing in Martha’s bonnet; and the unread letter lay—guarded
by two china dogs—on the parlour mantelpiece awaiting
the carrier. For it had been decided, after nightly discussions
that were a change for Caleb from the Christadelphian curtain-lectures,
to fall back on Jinny after all. She was to read it to
Martha in Caleb’s careful absence, and was to be stopped if the
improper seemed looming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas, the best-laid schemes of mice and Marthas gang agley,

ambled under the drooping witch-elms towards the twin doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a tilt-cart,—with two tall wheels, and although Jinny

<p class='pindent'>You gather that she operated under the shadow of a great
name, greatest as being masculine. Self-standing careers for
women had not yet dawned on the world. If the first faint
cloud of feminism had appeared that very year in New York, no
bigger than a man’s pants, the Bloomerites had but added to
the gaiety of mankind, and in rural Essex, with the exception of
dressmaking, wherein man appeared unnatural, women were the
recognized practitioners only of witchcraft or fortune-telling or
the concoction of philters; professions that were the peculiar
province of crones scarcely to be considered sexed. Though
women earned money by plaiting straw, they had husbands on
the premises. Widows, of course, for whom there was no provision
outside the Chipstone poorhouse, were allowed to maintain
themselves more manfully than spinsters: but then they were
“relicts” of the masculine, had served—so to speak—an
apprenticeship under it. But the business of plying between
Chipstone and Bradmarsh was a peculiarly male occupation, and
even the venerable name of Daniel Quarles would not have
sufficed to shield or install Jinny had she jumped into his place
as abruptly as Nip was apt to jump into the cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, Rome was not built in a day, nor could Jinny have become
the carrier “all of an onplunge,” as Caleb would have put it.
That would have shocked the manners and morals of Bradmarsh,
both Little and Long, and upset the decorum of Chipstone. A
gradual preparation had been necessary, a transition by which
Jinny changed into the carrier as imperceptibly as she had
ripened into the girl. At first the small “furriner”—the carried
and not the carrier—reposing in the cart because, after smallpox
had snatched away both her parents in the same week, her
grandfather, who had imported her, had nowhere else to put
her; playing in the great canvas-covered playground that held
as many heights, depths, and obstacles as a steeplechase course;
petted by every client for her helplessness before her helpfulness
gave her a second lease of favour; bearing a literally larger and
larger hand in “Gran’fer’s” transactions as he grew older and
older; correcting with cautious tact his memories, his accounts,
his muddled bookings and deliveries, in due course ousting the
octogenarian even from his place on the driving-board and
carrying him first by her side and then inside in his second
childhood, just as he had carried her in her first—a stage in
which his cackle with the customers carried on the continuity of
the male tradition; leaving him at home on bad days—whether
his own or Nature’s—and then altogether in the winter, and then
altogether in the spring, and then altogether in the autumn, and
finally—when he reached his nineties—altogether in the summer;
Jinny the Carrier was—it will be seen—a shock so subtly prepared
and so long discounted as to have been practically imperceptible.
She might crack Daniel’s heavy whip, but nobody felt the
flourish as other than vicarious, if not indeed a sort of play-acting
evoking the pleasure a more sophisticated audience finds
in Rosalind’s swashbucklings. Not that she made any brazen
pretences to equality in lifting boxes; she sat with due feminine
humility while male muscles swelled and contracted under her
presiding smile and the rippling music of her thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was, in fact, the prosaic purpose of the little horn slung
at her side—her one apparent embellishment of the tradition:
it summoned her slavish superiors so that she might be spared
alighting and re-climbing with goods. In face of the accuracy of
her operations, this display of helplessness probably helped to
remove the sting of an otherwise intolerable feminine sufficiency:
it was perhaps the secret of her popularity. Even with the most
Lilliputian packets nobody expected Jinny to descend and knock
at their doors—one blast and old and young tumbled over one
another to greet the coming or speed the parting parcel. It was
indeed as if a good fairy should condescend to do your marketing,
a fairy in a straw bonnet (piquantly tied under the chin in a bow
with drooping ends), a fairy whose brilliant smile and teeth and
flowing ringlets could convert even an order for jalap into poetry,
nay, induce in the eternal masculine a craving for more. In fine,
so topsy-turvily had this snail-paced transition worked, so
slowly had Jinny’s freedom broadened down from precedent to
precedent, that when strangers expressed disapproval at these
mannish courses, Little Bradmarsh was shocked, Long Bradmarsh
surprised, and Chipstone scornful. Not that they were at all
prepared to argue the question in the abstract. Their prejudice
against carrying as a profession for women remained as rooted
and unshaken as the critic’s. Women? Who was speaking of
women? Jinny was Jinny—a being unique and irreplaceable,
“bless her bonny fice.” It contributed to her unquestionability
that the Quarleses had been carriers for a hundred years—and
more.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did Jinny, for her part, generalize on the other side or
take any conscious interest in the emancipation of her sex. Her
horn blew no challenge to the world. It did not even occur to
her that she was doing anything out of the common—the tilt-cart
had been her nursery, it was now her place of business. She had
come into its foreground so unconsciously that it was not as a
good fairy that she saw herself, nor even as an attractive asset
of the Quarles concern, but as a busy toiler—driven from morning
to night rather than driving—and handicapped not only by her
household and garden work, her goats and poultry, but by a
nonagenarian grandfather, shaky in health and immovable in
opinion. Fortunately for her temper—and for the chastening of
a tongue only too a-tingle with rustic wit—Jinny regarded the
cantankerous patriarch as no more an object for back-talk than
a suckling. It had become second nature to soothe and humour
him; and she knew him as she knew the highways and byways
in the dark or the snow: where to turn and where to go round,
where to skirt a swamp and where to shave a ditch. By way of
compensation there was his affection—as primitive as Nip’s or
Methusalem’s—and evoking as primitive a response. For Jinny
was none of your genteel heroines with ethereal emotions and
complex aspirations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not that Nature had not cast her for a poetic part—she
was small and slender enough, and her light grey eyes behind
dark lashes sufficiently subtilized her expression, and when she
was hesitating between two words—not two opinions, for she
always had one—her little mouth would purse itself enchantingly.
There was gentility too about her toes. As her grandfather
remarked with his archaic pronouns and plurals: “That has the
smallest fitten I ever saw to a wench!” She certainly did not
dress the part, for despite the witchery of the bonnet, her workaday
skirt and stout shoes proclaimed the village girl, as her
hands proclaimed the drudge who scoured and scrubbed and
baked and dug and manured: indeed what with her own goats
and her farmyard commissions, she was almost as familiar with
the grosser aspects of animal life as that strangely romanticized
modern figure, the hospital nurse. The delicate solicitude of
Martha on her behalf was thus a pure morbidity, for in going to
and fro like a weaver’s shuttle, Jinny could scarcely remain
ignorant that women were as liable to offspring as any other
females, though it seemed a part of Nature’s order that had no
more to do with herself than the strange, hirsute growths on the
masculine face—or for the matter of that on Miss Gentry’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fallow, the old pastor of Little Bradmarsh, who, though
despised and rejected of Dissent, required—being human—comestibles,
candles, and shoe-strings from Chipstone, as well as
the disposal of his honey and his smaller tithes, was among
Jinny’s favourite clients, her original horror of Bradmarsh
Church having been early modified by an accidental peep one
weekday morning, which revealed its priest as its sole occupant.
Yet, standing in his place in his white surplice, he was going
through the service with such devout self-forgetfulness that the
confused child wondered whether the Satan of worldliness had
him so entirely gripped as she had been given to understand.
She did not know that this very praying all to himself would
have shocked Miss Gentry as savouring of the abhorred High
Churchmanship. Indeed “little better than a Papist” the
Chipstone curate had pronounced the harmless old widower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He for his part had long admired the little carrier, and perceiving
the fine shape of her calloused fingers, no less than the smallness
of her sturdy shoes, and enjoying the tang of her tongue—for the
cottage women, though nimbler than their lords, were not witty—he
had indulged his antiquarian vein (and the abundant leisure
due to the ravages of Dissent) by tracing for her a less plebeian
and more Churchy pedigree. Foiled in the hope of connecting her
with Francis Quarles of “Emblems” fame, he found in Norden’s
list of the Ancient Halls of Essex a Spring Elm Manor appertaining
to one Jonathan Quarles. The flockless pastor had even
journeyed in quest of this Hall and found illogical confirmation
in the fact of its continued existence, in all the pride of mullioned
windows and lily-strewn if muddy moat, though with its private
chapel turned into a stable and its piscina bricked over. Henceforward
he saw in the exuberant vitality and imperious obstinacy
of Daniel Quarles only an impoverished reincarnation of hard-living
but ecclesiastically correct squiredom, while in Jinny, with
her generous visits to the ailing and bed-ridden on her route, he
elected to behold a re-embodied Lady Bountiful, pride of a
feudal parish. What was prosaically certain, however, was that
Jinny had not even the education of Bundock’s bunch of girls,
the only school she had ever attended being the Peculiars’
Sunday-school held at a house adjoining the chapel in an interval
between the services. Thither, as to the services—her grandfather
being a Wesleyan—she had been convoyed regularly by
Caleb, packed into a cart with as many of the Flynt boys as had
not yet flown off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the business itself forced reading and writing upon her,
though when its sole responsibility devolved on her, and it was
no longer necessary to confute the old man’s memory by the
written word or figure, she found herself agreeably able to
dispense with the learned arts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Welcomed at lonely farmyards where fierce dogs sometimes
broke their chains for the joy of licking her hand or of flying at
Nip’s throat; not less welcome in village High Streets, where
every other house would ply her fussily with orders that she took
coolly and without a single note, her bosom knowledge of everybody’s
business and her dramatic interpretation of any abnormal
commission infusing life into her work that saved her from slips
of memory; adored by all the swains and yokels who hauled her
goods and chattels up and down, but radiating only a frosty
sunshine in return, for none had ever been able to pass the ice-barrier
that separated her private self from her professional
geniality; jumping down herself only to give Christian burial to
hapless moles, rats, shrews, leverets, and blood-stained feathers,
or to glean for lonely old women or the numerous and impoverished
Pennymole family the unconscious largesse of more
careless drivers—turnips, lumps of coal, wisps of hay; chaffering
with beaming shopkeepers on behalf of her clients, and hail-fellow-well-met
with her fellow-carriers, encountered at cross-roads
or “The Black Sheep”; Jinny pursued her unmaidenly
career in fine weather or foul, sometimes wayworn, wind-whipped,
rain-drenched, and with aching forehead, but more often with a
vital joy that was not least keen when Methusalem—cloud-exhaling
and clogged by snow that sometimes raised the road as
high as the hedges—had to plough his way along a track hewn
out by labourers, with here and there a siding cut in the glittering
mass for carts to pass each other by. Those were days not
devoid of danger: road, hedge, ditch, and field obliterated in one
snowy expanse. Once Jinny’s cart had to be dug out like a
crusted fossil of the Ice Age—and only the agonized howling of
Nip had brought rescue.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time he had justified his air of managing the
whole concern round which he barked and bounded and scurried
as though Methusalem and Jinny were his minions. He had
indeed commandeered them—jumping originally out of nowhere
on to the tail-board—and however he strayed from the path of
their duty in his numberless tangential excursions and expeditions,
they knew he would never abandon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like many other great characters Nip was a mongrel. His
foundation was fox-terrier, and he had preserved the cleverness
of the strain without its pluck. To strangers, indeed, he seemed
a very David among dogs, attacking, as he sometimes did,
canine Goliaths. But no dog is a hero to his mistress, and after
he had adopted her, Jinny discovered that these resounding
assaults on the bulkier were but bravado passages, based on his
flair that the bigger dog was also the bigger coward. That was
where his brains came in, as well as his baser breed. A sniff at
a real fighter and Nip would evade combat, sauntering off with
a nonchalant air. A splash of brown on his brainpan and about
his ears, and a dab of black on his snout were—with his leathern
collar—the sole touches of relief in his sleek whiteness. His
head—beautifully poised and shaped—with its bright dark-brown
eye, eloquently expressive and passing easily from love
to greediness, from shyness to shame, invited many a pat from
lovers of the soulful. Yet to hear him bolt a rabbit was to
imagine a demon on the war-path: in a flash the cart would be
left a furlong behind or athwart; his raucous staccato yells filled
the meadows with echoes of blood-lust and revenge. But long
experience had dulled Jinny’s solicitude for Bunny: never once
was there a sign of a kill. Sometimes, indeed, when Nip was
hunting a rat, the creature would run across the path under his
very nose, but that nose, pushing eagerly for far-off game, never
seemed able to readjust itself to what was under it. All the
which maladroitness was probably artfulness, Nip scenting
shrewdly that a successful sports-dog would have been hounded
out. He knew well the foolish, treacherous heart of his mistress,
who actually misled the hunt those autumn mornings that
brought the high-mettled hares across their path with ears taut
and every muscle tragically astrain. Up would come the beagles,
with a long processional flutter of waving white tails, nosing
forlornly and barking dismally, while he—panting to put them
right—was tied paw and paw. How they set him quivering,
those horn-tootlings of the gorgeous Master, though they did
not go to his bowels as much as those staccato chivies that
suggested that the green-and-white gentleman was one of themselves
rather than a biped, or as those more elaborately contorted
cries and rousing thong-cracks of the Whipper-in. A fellow-feeling
makes us wondrous kind. And when all these hunters—four-footed
or two-footed—including the draggletail of fat,
breathless farmers and wheezing females, were remorselessly sent
the wrong way by his brutal mistress, the poor dog could not
refrain from wailing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even when the hare did not cross her path, her horn, imitating
the professional toot, would allure and misguide the distant dogs.
Nip’s own relatives, the foxhounds, more rarely came his way,
but though his mistress’s sympathies with the quarry were less
marked—her chickens being precious—Nip was still held in.
But amid all his disgust the cunning dog remembered that his
days of foraging for himself—before he had picked up Jinny—had
not been rosy and replete: caterers like Jinny, he realized,
did not grow on every cart, not to mention the cushioned basket
from which he could bark at everything on the road, or within
which, with a huge grunt of satisfaction, he could curl into an
odorous dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A contrast in all save colour was the stolid Methusalem,
though he too was of hybrid stock. While his hairy fetlocks
proclaimed a kinship with the draught-breed of the shire, he
lacked that gross spirit, and while his flying mane and tail
flaunted an affinity with the fiery Arab, he was equally deficient
in that high mettle. By what romantic episode he had come
into being, whether through the wild oats of an Arabian ancestor,
or the indiscretion of a mere circus-horse, or whether his tossing
hair and tail were the heritage from a Shetland pony—as his
moderate stature suggested—is not recorded in any stud-book.
But it was impossible to see him without the word “steed”
coming into the mind, and equally impossible to sit behind him
without thinking of a plough-horse. “When Oi first see that
rollin’ in the brook afore ’twas broke in,” Gaffer Quarles would
relate, “Oi was minded of the posters of Mazeppa at the Fair,
and christened that accordin’.” It was only when he discovered
that this blonde beast was a whited sepulchre, that “Mazeppa”
was exchanged for “Methusalem,” as though that antediluvian
worthy had always been a doddering millenarian, and not at one
time in the prime of his hundreds. The name had at least the
effect of banishing expectation; his mere amble was an agreeable
surprise. As a matter of fact Methusalem had still his Mazeppa
moments. They came on Tuesday and Friday evenings when
he was loosed from the shafts; at which moments he would roll
on his back, kick up his heels and gallop madly round the goat-pasture
to the alarm of the tethered browsers. And even at his
professional pace he always kept his mane flying. One accomplishment,
however, Methusalem had which no “Mazeppa”
steed could have bettered, nay, which made a circus pedigree
plausible. He could lift the latch of gates with his nose and
walk through. It was a trick which Jinny, with her habit of
not alighting, had fostered in him: if the gate did not swing to,
she could usually close it with the butt-end of her whip—through
the cart-rear at the worst—a procedure which, with her further
habit of using short cuts and even private tracks like that at
Bellropes Park, saved not a little time, and was some compensation
for Methusalem’s general crawl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the local carrying business had grown indistinguishable from
Jinny, it seemed no less bound up with her four-footed companions,
whose ghostly figures, seen looming through the wintry
dusk, sent a glow of warmth through the bleak countryside.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But to-day Jinny’s horn, Nip’s yap, and Methusalem’s pseudo-spirited
pawing, were alike powerless to evoke the familiar forth-bustling
of Caleb and Martha. Only cocks crowed and doves
moaned, while from the river-slope came the lowing of cattle.
Alarmed for the lonely and aged couple, Jinny jumped down and
tapped at the door. Nobody replying, she lifted the latch and
came from the joyous spring sunshine on a chill, silent piece of
hall-way in which even the tall clock had stopped dead. She
peeped perfunctorily into the musty parlour on her way to the
kitchen—the lozenge-shaped motto: “When He giveth quietness,
who then can make trouble?” seemed to have taken on a
strange and solemn significance. But she knew that the kitchen
was the likeliest lair, so not pausing to examine, the ominously
unopened letter addressed to Mrs. Flynt which she espied on the
mantelpiece, she pressed on to the rear. The kitchen, however,
was still more desolate, not only of the couple, but of the habitual
glow on the cavernous hearth. What wonder if Nip, who had
followed her, set up an uncanny whining! She halloaed up the
staircase, but that only aggravated the silence. She dashed
next door to the shepherd’s section—similar solitude! With a
feeling of lead at her heart she rushed back into the ironic sunshine
and towards the orchard—now unbearably beautiful in its
blossoming—and as she was approaching a remote corner that
harboured the pigsty in which Martha’s pet sow carried on a
lucrative maternity, she was half relieved to collide with Caleb
who was moving houseward with haggard eyes and carpet
slippers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything the matter?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sow glad you’ve come. The missus keeps arxing for you.
We’ve been up all night with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With your wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked astonished. “Noa, Maria!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s full relief found vent in a peal of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no laughin’ matter—the missus wants ye to tell the wet
to come at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s the matter with her?” inquired Jinny, still
unable to rise to his seriousness. “A snout-ache?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a goner,” said Caleb solemnly. “We’ve reared up
nine boys, but Maria’s been more trouble than the lot. The
missus would bring her up by hand, and Oi always prophesied
she wouldn’t live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amusedly aware that Maria’s progeny had already exceeded
sixty, Jinny offered to visit the patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do—that’ll comfort the missus and ye’ll know better what
to tell Jorrow. Oi’ll hold your hoss. You know the way—behind
the red may-tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny smiled again. The idea of Methusalem needing restraint
amused her, but she did not dispel Caleb’s romantic illusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sick sty was visible through a half-door that gave at once
air and view, and over which Nip at once bounded on to the
startled Martha’s back as she hung over the prostrate pig on its
bed of dirty straw. Maria belonged to the Society of Large
Black Pigs, and snuffed the world through a long, fine snout;
but life had evidently lost its savour, for the poor sow was
turning restlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny!” moaned Martha. “She had thirteen last time,
and I knew it was an unlucky number.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” quoth Jinny gaily. “Twelve would have been
less lucky—at the price I got you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dearie, but I’m not thinking of prices. She was a
birthday present for my loneliness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Jinny gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t.” She wrung her hands. The self-possession
Caleb had admired when the letter broke on their lives was no
longer hers. “You’ve got lots of Brethren and Sisters, but I’ve
got nobody to break bread with, no fraternal gatherings to go
to, and even Flynt won’t be immersed, though he’s in his sixty-nine
and we must all fall asleep some day. So it was a comfort
to have Maria following me about everywhere like Nip does you,
and I do believe she’s got more sense than the so-called Christians
here, and would be the first to pray for the peace of Jerusalem
with me if she could only speak. But now even Maria may be
taken from me. You’ll send Jorrow at once, won’t you, dearie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s the matter with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see? All night she kept rooting up the ground.
Oh, I hope it isn’t fever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish! Look at the skin of her ears. And she isn’t
coughing at all. What’s she been overeating?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing—only the grass Flynt has been cutting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you give her a dose of castor-oil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She won’t take it. She knows we’ve covered it up—I told
you she’s got as much brains as a Christian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me try and get it down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> down. The piglets ate the mess up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear!” laughed Jinny. “That <span class='it'>will</span> need Jorrow.
Anything else, Mrs. Flynt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think this morning. Ask Flynt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb, however, proved equally distraught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was summat extra special, Oi know,” he said, his red-shirted
arm clinging heroically to Methusalem’s bridle, “for
here’s the knot in my hankercher. But what it singafies Lord
onny knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t a new shirt?” she suggested slyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “Noa, noa; this keeps her colour as good
as new. But the missus did make a talk about my Sunday
neckercher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get you a new one. Plain or speckled?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi leaves that to you, Jinny—you know more about stoylish
things.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On her winding and much-halting way to Chipstone, Jinny
took advantage of the absence of the noble family and the complaisance
of her customer, the lodge-keeper, to smuggle her
plebeian vehicle through Bellropes Park, which was not only a
mile shorter, but dodged the turnpike with its aproned harpy of
a tollman; she loved the great avenues of oaks, and the shining
lake, the game of swans, and the sense of historic splendour;
and Nip, as if with a sense of stolen sweets, sniffed never more
happily, though when they got within view of the water, he had
to be summoned back to his headquarters-basket by a stern
military note, a combat between himself and the swans not
commending itself to his mistress. Some of these irascible
Graces floated now on the margin, meticulously picking their
tail-feathers, contorting their necks. But vastly more exciting
were those of the flock far out on that spacious sparkle of brown
water. They seemed to be going spring-mad and threshing the
scintillating water with their wings, oaring themselves thus along,
each one infecting the other, till the water itself seemed to be
leaping in a shimmering frenzy of froth. Even the ducks reared
up or stood on their heads in a sort of intoxication. And this
sense of the joy and beauty of the spring communicated itself to
the girl, not in jubilance, but in some exquisite wistfulness: some
craving of the blood for mysterious adventure. Something
seemed calling at once out of the past and out of the future.
And then her thoughts wandered back to Frog Farm and the
Flynts and the far-scattered youths with whom she had formerly
ridden to Sunday-school, and suddenly by a flash from her
subconsciousness she recognized the writing of the unopened
letter on Martha’s mantelpiece: of the letter she had scarcely
looked at. Surely, though the curves were bolder, it was the
work of the very same male hand that had written on the fly-leaf
of a Peculiar hymn-book the inspired quatrain—which she had
admired from her childhood—beginning:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Steal not this book for fear of shame:</span></p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>an admonition she thought peculiarly appropriate to the holy
book it guarded. And with the memory of the fly-leaf surged up
also the face—the long-forgotten, freckled face of the youngest
and most headstrong of the Flynt boys: the Will, flouted
as “Carrots,” but in her opinion the handsomest of the batch,
who had always loomed over her with such grown-up if genial
grandeur, and had given her his bull-roarer and threaded birds’
eggs for her before she had come to think their collection wicked.
What a hullabaloo when the boy disappeared—he must have
been hardly thirteen, she began computing—and she, the child
of nine or so who could have comforted the distracted Martha,
had dared say no word, because he had made her swear on that
very hymn-book to keep his flight silent. Just as she was
permeated by the solemnity of the book and the oath on it, he
had thrown it away, she remembered, thrown it into the
bushes from the wagon in which he was driving her home from
chapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The details of that forgotten summer Sunday began to come
back: most vividly of all, the boy struggling and sobbing when
his buttons were cut off. He had been so proud of his new
velvet jacket with its manifold rows of blue buttons, and lo!
after Sunday-school his father had appeared with a somewhat
crestfallen look and a pair of scissors, saying, “You don’t want
all this flummery,” while Elder Mawhood—evidently the
admonishing angel—had stood grimly by, intoning “Pride is
abominable. Wanity must be rooted out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy had choked back his sobs, and apparently found
solace in the evening hymns, and was further soothed by being
allowed at his own request to drive the party home. It was felt—especially
by Martha—some compensation for the buttons was
due to him. Thus when the wagon had reached Swash End and
the bulk of the Flynt family got off according to custom—mud
and weather permitting—and walked up to Frog Farm, leaving
Jinny to be driven round the long detour to her home at Blackwater
Hall, she was left alone with Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that, having asked her if she could keep a secret
and being assured she could, he informed her to her admiring
horror that the moment he had safely delivered her on the road
by the Common, he would turn his horse’s head for Harwich,
where (stabling the horse and wagon so that his parents might
trace his intention) he would take ship as a cabin-boy or a
stowaway for America, where he was sure to come across his
brother Ben, and never would she see him again in Bradmarsh
till he had made his fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could see him now, under a late sunset that was like his
hair, with his flashing, freckled face, his blazing blue eyes, and
his poor, defaced jacket, the thready stubs of the big buttons
showing like scars. Their quaint dialogue came back vividly to
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Will, but can’t you make your fortune here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you—no more chapel for me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it’s hard—and you did look beautiful with the
buttons—but isn’t it more beautiful to please God?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish! What does God care about my buttons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s pleased, just as I like your giving me birds’ eggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I didn’t give my buttons—they were snatched from me—through
that, beastly old Mawhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Elder Mawhood knows what God wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him cut off his own nose and not go smelling into everybody’s
business. The other day he made poor old Sister Tarbox
get riddy of her cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was kindness, because it had to be shut up alone all
Sunday while she was at chapel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe it was only to make more rats for him to kill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not true, Will. You know Sister Tarbox is too poor
to have her cottage cleared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let him look after his rats and cats—not me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An elder must do his duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate elders and deacons and hymn-books. Yah! I’m
done with religion, thank God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Will, you mustn’t speak like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy stewing in chapel in weather like this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t this just the weather to thank God for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—it’s all silliness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is! You ask Brother Bundock—I don’t mean old
Mr. Bundock. I asked him once who wrote our hymn-book and
he said, ‘’Twixt you and I, the village idiot!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are talking wickedly, Will”—there were tears in the
voice now. “You mustn’t run away, that’s more wicked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—I was an idiot myself to tell you. You are going to
peach on me, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell your grandfather about my running away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if you don’t do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I shall do it! And you promised to keep the secret. To
tell would be more wicked than me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t tell, but you mustn’t go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must. Swear not to betray me. Kiss my hymn-book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with some soothed sense of restored sanctities that she
had pressed her lips to the holy cover—she still remembered its
smell and taste, salted with a tear of her own—but what a fresh
and mightier shock, that throwing of the book into the bushes!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! Stop!” She heard the little girl’s horror-struck cry
over the years; remembered how, as he laughed and drove on
furiously with her, the phrase “drive like the devil” had come
to her mind, charged for the first time with meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilful boy had had his way: he had escaped from England
and even—despite his diabolism—by the aid of the ninepence she
had insisted on bringing down from her money-box while he
waited trustfully outside her grandfather’s domain. But she had
not responded in kind to the lordly kiss he had blown her as he
drove off to America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, little Jinny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Will. Say your prayers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall pray for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the hue and cry was out, and bellmen were busy with his
carroty head and velvet jacket with the buttons cut off, little
Jinny had also gone a-hunting—but for the outraged hymn-book.
It lay now still hidden in a drawer—the one secret of her life—unmentioned
even when by the bulky clue of the horse and
cart the fugitive had been traced, as he designed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, she must disinter this hymn-book of his from its hiding-place,
compare the inscription—she knew by now the rhyme was
not original—with her memory of Martha’s letter. What was its
postmark, she wondered. Well, she would find that out, indeed
the whole contents, on her return to Frog Farm. Perhaps he
was coming back—his fortune already made. And the revived
sense of his wickedness was mixed with a sense of her own soon-forgotten
resolve—or threat—to pray for him, and was blurred
in some strange emotion, in which the glamorous freshness of
child-feeling mingled with a leaping of the heart that was like
the spring-joy of the swans.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But Jorrow could not make the journey that day to that
remote farm. There were more important animals more expensively
endangered and more easily accessible. Old sows were so
fussy, and to judge by the symptoms it was a mere case for
castor-oil. But precisely because Jinny had herself recommended
this drug-of-all-work she felt unconvinced: it seemed a
mere glib formula for being “riddy” of her. There was another
resource, Elijah Skindle, who, having settled in Chipstone only
five years ago, practised only among parvenus like himself. It
was not because he was a “furriner,” nor even because he had
started as a knacker and still had a nondescript status, that
Jinny shrank from calling him in now: she had more than once
deposited damaged dogs with him or deported them mended. But
she objected to the appraising gaze he fixed upon her on these
occasions, though to be sure her objection to these jaunts was not
so strong as Nip’s, who, seeing in every canine co-occupant of
the cart a possible supplanter, bristled and whined and barked till
the rival was safely discharged. But, on her way home, overcoming
her repugnance—for Martha’s sake, if not Maria’s or
duty’s—she stopped her cart outside his pretentious black gauze
blind and blew a rousing blast. A tall, black-eyed, grey-haired
woman, issuing from the office door with a broom, who appeared
to be Mr. Skindle’s mother, informed her that ’Lijah was “full
up”: however, he could be found at the kennels if Jinny insisted
on seeing him. She pointed vaguely to a field behind the house,
visible through an unpaved alley yawning between the sober
Skindle window and its flamboyant neighbour, the chemist’s.
But it was in vain that Jinny clucked to Methusalem to thread
the alley. The beast refused absolutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alighting with some dim understanding of his instinct, she
walked to the field-gate over which a horse was gazing at her.
Lifting the latch, she wandered among other happily scampering
horses in search of the kennels, finding at first only a barn-like
structure, a glance through whose doors at the flagstoned paving
that sloped to a centre turned her sick. For a pyramid of
horses’ feet was the least repulsive indication, though even the
homely skewers so agreeable to Squibs took on a sinister hue.
The spectacle, however, served to make the kennels, when at
last discovered, a lesser horror. But it was the first time she
had seen dogs so far gone in distemper, and these rheumy-eyed
skeletons, each chained in its niche, sullied the springtide and
haunted her for days. She caught up Nip, who had come to
heel, as though he too might pine suddenly into skin and bone.
Nip himself, it must be confessed, regarded these shadows of his
species with indifference, if not with satisfaction, as negligible
competitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah Skindle, discovered on his knees in the act of feeding a
pathetic poodle, was as unstrung by the sight of Jinny as Jinny
by the sight of the dogs. His black cutty pipe fell from his lips
and he nearly stuck the dog’s spoon into his own open mouth.
But mastering himself, and without raising his cap or his pipe
or changing his attitude, he gasped out: “Hullo! Nip ill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny replied curtly—for there was a familiarity that repelled
her in his calling Nip by his right name—, “No, a sow at Frog
Farm—Little Bradmarsh, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His heart leapt. Frog Farm meant an old inhabitant, local
prejudice was then beginning to melt at last! But, “Rather
out of my radius,” he said with pretended indifference. “Besides,”
as he reached for his pipe, “my nag’s gone lame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could give you a lift,” said Jinny, outwitted for once, since
it never struck her that this was precisely what Elijah had
fished for and why he had lamed his beast. The spoon trembled
in his hand, but he replied grumblingly, “But then I should
have to come at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid so,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Skindle rose and brushed his knees. “Anything to oblige
a lady,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t me, it’s Maria,” said Jinny icily.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But Jinny was not altogether outmanœuvred, for while Mr.
Skindle was getting his case of utensils, she filled up the rest of
her seat—it was a stuffed seat covered with sacking—by means
of a peculiarly precious parcel, needing a vigilant eye: no new
device this, but her habitual protection against bores or adorers,
and Skindle, she feared, was both. This swain-chaser or maid-protector
was kept in a corner of the cart ready for emergencies,
being an elongated package of stones, marked “Fragile.” The
stones had to be jagged and uncouth or Nip would have squatted
on it and roused suspicion. This was the only parcel she lifted
herself, and it figured in her own mind as “The Scarecrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, despite Mr. Skindle’s offer to nurse it on his knees,
she put him behind her—not as a Satan, for his seductiveness was
small. He had, it is true, a good styside manner, and his slim
figure, outlined by a trimly cut pepper-and-salt suit, effused a
sense of vitality. But his straw-coloured moustache, which was
not without its female votaries, was for Jinny more of a puzzle
than a decoration, for she could not reconcile its flowingness with
the desolating baldness that any shifting of his cap revealed. His
cranium was, in fact, like the advertisement of a hair-restorer in
the picture preceding the application thereof. As fixed a feature
of his face as the grey cap which concealed his calvity was the
black cutty pipe stuck in his stained teeth, nor had Jinny ever
seen him without a large pearl horseshoe pin in his tie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t smoke,” she said, as he climbed in by the tail-board,
“Gran’fer would smell it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why shouldn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a Wesleyan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” He laughed without comprehension, a shade scoffingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the smell might get into people’s parcels,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bestowing himself under the tilt as well as he could on a box,
grazed at his side by a ledge he considered too narrow to sit on, and
threatened with decapitation through a plank holding the smaller
parcels that ran athwart the cart just above his head, Mr. Skindle
gazed up over this shelf at the glorious view of the back of
Jinny’s bonnet and feasted his eyes on her graceful dorsal curves
and the more variegated motions of her driving arm, not to
mention the succession of lovely rural backgrounds made for her
figure by the arch of the awning. And his ill-humour melted,
and though his pipe grew cold his heart began to glow. But
Jinny took no more notice of him than if he had been himself a
box. No wonder he began to feel closed and corded up, bursting
though he knew himself to be with soul-riches. For a full mile,
his extinct pipe in his teeth, he heard only the monotonous snap
of Methusalem’s hoofs as if everything along the road was
snapping in a frost. The unjaded steed had actually started off
at almost a trot, and as the Gaffer explained once, “a hoss what
has long lopes knocks his fitten together.” Then—as if to mark
how completely her passenger was forgotten—one of her grandfather’s
songs began to steal from her lips. It was not “High
Barbary” nor “Admiral Benbow,” nor yet his favourite “Oi’m
seventeen come Sunday,” which the nonagenarian sang daily
with growing conviction. It was—and Nip would have been
the first to be surprised, had he understood it—the old English
air:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>The hunt is up, the hunt is up, and it is wellnigh day,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>And Harry our King has gone huntynge, to bring the deer to bay.</span></p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was the influence of her horn; perhaps she was an
artist who could enjoy in song what she could not suffer in life.
Or perhaps she loved the lilt of the old song and never thought
of the meaning, or only of the bravery of the spectacle and the
gay coming of the dawn. For, all untrained as she was, she
vibrated peculiarly to music, and one of the wonderful moments
of her young life was when she first heard a hymn sung in parts
at the Sunday-school; to her ear, accustomed only to the solo
quavering of the Gaffer, was revealed harmony; a starry new
universe and a blood-tickling enchantment in one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost at the first outbreak of the hunting song Nip appeared
at a run, and with two bounds he established himself in his
mistress’s lap—invidiously enough in Elijah’s eyes. For that
silvery little voice, rippling along the lonely road with the
unconscious joyance of a blackbird’s, completed the spell which
the spring landscape—seen in that series of pictures framed by
the arch of the tilt—was weaving on the doomed veterinary
surgeon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were sheep, big and little, lying in the wide fields and
great, newly ploughed spaces of red, freshly turned earth—for
the first time Elijah felt the scarecrows as a degradation of all
this primeval beauty. Apple-trees flowered in the cottage
gardens and in the hedges was early May-blossom, and on the
brinks primroses, anemones, and even a few precocious bluebells
rioted in an intoxicating fertility of beauty. Larks rose palpitating
with song, bumble-bees boomed, butterflies flittered, and
ever and anon came the haunting cry of the cuckoo. And when
Jinny’s voice soared up too, Elijah Skindle’s heart seemed melting
down his spine.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a lucky dog of yours,” he said desperately, when the
music ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I thought at your place,” she replied through
the back of her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not had distemper yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw her shoulders shudder. There was an awkward silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I’d gladly look after him gratis,” he blundered on,
“and you too.” Then, in a horrible consciousness of the pathological
implication, he awaited the lash of her tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she must have been abstracted. For she only said
politely: “Thanks very much. But I always go to Jorrow’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, he reflected bitterly, and always went there for other
people unless Skindle’s was expressly stipulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they were now approaching the first village after Chipstone,
and the outside world intruded on the idyll. A dozen times he
vaulted up and down to prevent interloping young men—sometimes
armed with nosegays—receiving parcels too proximately;
and he had a proud and malicious pleasure in their disconcerted
unspoken surmise as to his privileged situation. The small coin
of conversation appertaining to these deliveries Jinny did not
refuse him, and every cluck she gave to Methusalem, every ripple
of laughter on her busy way, deepened the spell. The unexpected
faces; the quaint cottage interiors; the cheerful-smiling women
in high green aprons who received stay-laces or bobbins, sugar or
tea-packets, in bare dough-powdered or soap-frothed arms; the
panting figures that tolled after the cart with forgotten bundles;
the dogs—the fiercer in their barrels and boxes, the milder
waving free and friendly tails; the quaint commissions and
monitions, the salutations and farewells—“I’ll remember the
twopence,” “And tell my brother, won’t you, about the christening,”
“I don’t want any more of her puddings, they put the
miller’s eye out”—all this fascinating bustle and chatter, spiced
with friendly laughter, seemed to belong to an enchanted earth
of which gaiety was the ground-note, not animal groaning. The
windings of her horn completed his sense of fairyland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the remoter woodland regions he was possessed alternately
with a disapprobation of her recklessness in trusting herself thus
alone with a male, far from help, and a surprise at his own
passivity in so provoking and romantic a situation. Of course he
was going to behave like the gentleman he was, but why was she so
irritatingly sure of it? Did she think he wasn’t flesh and blood?
She might at least show some consciousness of his chivalry!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his resentment at her professional nonchalance only
served to confirm his long-standing suspicion that here at last
was the girl for him: that he was choosing well if not wisely.
Doubtless Chipstone and his mother would say he was marrying
too much beneath him. But look at the farmers’ daughters—what
lumps beside her! He admitted, of course, that the
Blanche of Foxearth Farm to whom his mother mainly aspired
was an exception, but then this Purley minx was hopelessly out
of reach, stuck up on her pedestal of beauty, conceit, and culture,
and throwing over even her affianced wooers. As for his neighbour,
the chemist’s girl—what <span class='it'>could</span> his mother see in her except
that annuity which would not even survive her, and she not
looking particularly strong! No, with the present satisfactory
amount of sheep-rot, glanders, and distemper he could afford to
please himself. And if Jinny couldn’t play the piano like the
land-surveyor’s widow, why one must content oneself with the
horn, pending initiation into the higher life. Together they
would work up the business. With Jinny’s connexion—though
of course she must give up carrying and become a lady—there
would surely be a trail of sick beasts in her wake: Jorrow would
soon be out-distanced. They would live away from his office;
that could all be turned into dog-hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the kennels in the air built by the enamoured
Elijah as he sat on boxes or hampers or panted under their
weight in his officious deliveries: an officiousness which drove
out of her head the keg of oil destined for Uckford Manor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear!” she murmured suddenly, a mile later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forcing the explanation from her, he cried joyfully, “Let’s go
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny shook her head. “No time,” she said, and flicked at
Methusalem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t mind being late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not thinking of you—but of the pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bother the pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the way you study your patients?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got better things to study.” He could only say it to
her back, but he threw enough intensity into it to come out on
the other side of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!” The back seemed impenetrable. “You going
into another business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why ever should I when I’m getting on so famously—ten
pound a week, if a penny.” It was an opportunity made to his
hand. “I know,” he went on, as the back remained rigid, “that
folks pretend it’s not as high-class as real doctoring, but believe
me it needs more brains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stands to reason. A human being can tell you what he feels
and where the pain lays, but with a dumb beast you’ve got only
your own sense and skill to go on: it’s us vets that should really
be at the top of the profession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But sick babies are dumb too,” Jinny reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sick babies have talking mammas,” he replied genteelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny did not imitate them, and silence fell again, tempered by
Methusalem’s snappings. Really, it was very awkward, Elijah
felt, thus proposing to a girl behind her back. But he struggled
gallantly. “Take stomach staggers now—if those horses you
saw waiting to be killed this evening had been treated in
time——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The horses in your field?” cried Jinny, shocked. “But
they looked so lively.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re all like that,” he explained. “Once out of harness
they get a bit jaunty again, but they’re worth more dead than
alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s dreadful killing off a horse that has served one!” Jinny
burst out. “Just for a few shillings!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few shillings? Why there’s horses over two-fifty pounds!
Flesh, I mean,” he explained, with a chuckle. “Not to mention
the skin, hair and bones. Why, there’s eighty pounds of
intestines for sausage-skins!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do hold your tongue!” cried Jinny, feeling sick again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and what about <span class='it'>his</span> tongue!” retorted Elijah triumphantly.
“It ain’t only Frenchies that get that. And his
tail waving for funerals! And his hoofs in your own shoe-buttons!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny felt indeed as though hoofs had descended on her feet,
and she could almost have sacrificed Methusalem’s high-waving
tail to adorn her passenger’s obsequies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My neighbour, the chemist—he buys the blood!” continued
the ghoulish Elijah. “He makes it into——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just here at a cross-road Jinny’s horn signalled to a smart
young man in a velvet waistcoat, who was driving a trap, and
brought him to a standstill. Would Barnaby deliver a keg of
oil at Uckford Manor if he was passing that way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Manor was, it transpired, the one goal and purpose of
Barnaby’s journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny—well aware young Purley was homeward bound for
Foxearth Farm—gave him a radiant smile, and Elijah threw him
the keg and a furious look, a reliable fellow-feeling informing
him that the velvety liar was going at least two miles out of his
way. Downright dishonest he felt it, seeing that neither the
young man’s time nor his trap was his own, but belonged to his
father, the hurdle-maker. But what could you expect of
Blanche’s brother? Let Jinny beware of the family fickleness,
let her lean on a less showy but manlier breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder you don’t arrange your things village by village
instead of letting ’em lay all over the vehicle,” he observed as
she drove on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t forget where to drop you,” came the answer over
her cold shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then silence fell more painfully than ever, and the monotonous
tick-tack of Methusalem maddened his conscious ear. The monstrous
possibility began to loom up that Jinny’s affections were
pre-engaged to some one of these numerous young men. His
eye fell upon a coil of rope hung round a loose hoop of the tilt,
and morbid thoughts of using it—whether on the young men or
himself was not clear—floated vaguely in his usually serene soul.
Presently he noted other coils on other ribs, and their plurality
suggested it was for the young men, not himself, that rope was
appropriate. What else were they there for, he wondered dully?
Yes, let her fiancés go hang: engagements could always be
broken off—nothing venture, nothing have!</p>

<p class='pindent'>To nerve himself for the great question he took advantage of
the pause at Long Bradmarsh while Methusalem was drinking
at the trough of “The King of Prussia.” But this imitation of
Methusalem on a stronger fluid was fatal, for in Jinny’s persistent
silence, the animal’s tick-tacks now grew soothing: he settled
himself more comfortably on the emptier floor of the cart, with
his head on a soft bundle, and watched the nape of Jinny’s neck
till it faded into a great white sea of floating ice. He was
struggling in it for hours, but at last the cold waves passed over
his head, and Jinny, turning to throw out a parcel, saw that his
cap had fallen off in his writhings, leaving his baldness almost
indecently glaring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So deep was he in his daymare that he was quite unaware of
Jinny’s colloquy with another male whom her horn had hailed
as they passed over the bridge to Little Bradmarsh. Not that
there was anything in Ephraim Bidlake to excite apprehension,
for he was a stalwart Peculiar, safely married, and residing with
his family and two twin-nieces of his wife’s—Sophy and Sally—on
board the billyboy whose great boomless black sail Jinny had
espied darkening the water with its shadow. Bidlake’s barge
was a cross between a Norfolk wherry and a ferry-boat, and
plied up and down the Brad, loading at the wharves with its
half-lowered mast for crane, or carrying man and cattle across
the bridgeless sections when it had nothing better to do. There
was not much money coming in at the best, and it was often
Jinny’s privilege to eke out the barge’s larder under pretence of
presents for the motherless Sophy and Sally, so tragically
fathered. For Ephraim Bidlake, a shaggy giant with doglike
eyes, had brought the “little furriners” from Hampshire when
their mother died after their father—Mrs. Bidlake’s brother—had
been transported to Botany Bay for burning a rick in some
old agricultural riot against the introduction of machinery. The
blot on their scutcheon had been concealed from the new neighbourhood,
but had been gradually confided by Mrs. Bidlake to
Jinny with protestations of her brother’s innocence—had he not
been made a constable in the very convict ship? By degrees,
too, she had conveyed to the girl a vivid picture of the trial and
deportation. For the devoted sister had walked the bulk of the
way to Winchester, in the hope of proving his innocence by
collecting testimonies to his character, and had joined the mob
of weeping women who hung round the gaol gates night and day,
or crowded the court, only to witness the sanctimonious cruelty
of the bewigged judges, and the tragic exodus of the damned in
the prison coach, guarded by a file of soldiers, to lie in the hulks
at Southampton till they were shipped to savage Australia, there
to be assigned to brutal stockowners. It was an experience
which had cost Mrs. Bidlake dear; her next child had been
stillborn, and to this day she had never reared but one more
infant, and that a still delicate one. But for the comfort of the
Peculiar faith it would have been a cheerless household. She
was now again brought to bed: it was to inquire about her
that Jinny had hailed the barge, and very sad she was to learn
from Brother Bidlake—when he had punted within earshot—that
the new baby had succumbed after a few hours, though the
“missus,” thank God, was recovering and the twins were
“wunnerful good and helpful.” She was not sorry, however,
that the undoctored infant had departed with a precipitation
which rendered an inquest unlikely, for inquests were the bane
of the Brotherhood.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was twilight when Methusalem drew up again before the
twin doors. This time Caleb did not fail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sow glad you ain’t brought the wet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have—he’s snoring inside,” Jinny called down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord!” said Caleb, taking another look. “Oi did see his
head, but by this owl-light Oi thought ’twas a cheese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s laugh rippled out and Elijah Skindle started up and
sneezed. He looked round dazedly for his cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve arrived?” he asked shamefacedly, clapping it on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Jinny, “but the pig’s all right. I fear you’ve had
a wasted journey.” She jumped down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wasted?” He sat up ardently. “Don’t say wasted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good nap <span class='it'>is</span> a comfort,” she agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may have dozed off—your singing rocked me to sleep, I
reckon. But all the while I’ve been trying to tell you——”
His voice broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” she said softly. “I heard you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I talk in my sleep?” he asked innocently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through your nose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced as at a blow on it. “That’s—that’s nature,” he
stammered: “I don’t suppose even females are free from
snoring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maria isn’t,” observed Jinny, patting Methusalem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha hurried out happily, with a piece of sugar for the same
favoured beast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maria’s been walking with me!” she cried rapturously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And eating hearty,” added Caleb. “If you ask me, she was
drunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Flynt!” cried Martha. “Aren’t you ashamed to speak
like that about your own pig; and before strangers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that rolled and kicked last night same as a sow Oi seen
once that swallowed a thick wine. Happen Maria got swillin’
at old Peartree’s beer-barrel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could she do that?” Jinny protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turned on the tap like a Christian. Same as your Methusalem
opens our gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah picked up his pipe and his cap and scrambled down.
“Appears to me I’ve been brought here under false pretences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll pay you all the same,” said Caleb with dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how am I to get back to Chipstone?” He had followed
Maria in reckless abandonment, and now came the prose of life
with its questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we’re going to pay the gentleman,” put in Martha, “he
may as well have a look at Maria.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Skindle agreed it was as well to make a possible future
patient’s acquaintance, but repeated his inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Shanks’s mare,” said Jinny blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb pointed towards the brook. “It’s onny seven miles by
Swash End through Plashy Walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plashy Hall has a dog,” objected Elijah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re used to dogs,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My instrument-case is too heavy. You’ll have to give me
a lift to your house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure,” she said. “But Blackwater Hall is still
farther from Chipstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow I can get a trap from the village,” he said firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you can’t, and even if you walk to Long Bradmarsh it’s
a toss-up if you’ll get anything at ‘The King of Prussia.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, take me as far as the bridge—I’ll pay extra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t guarantee Methusalem will go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” he said cheerfully. “Horses know I stand
no nonsense. And now, Uncle, as soon as I’ve lit my pipe, I’ll
be ready for the pig. Got a match?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his disgust, Caleb produced a lucifer and a phial of sulphuric
acid for dipping it in. The now well-established friction matches—that
boon to the idle and extravagant—had not yet reached
Frog Farm, where even flint and steel had been dispossessed but
slowly. But the relit pipe was comforting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a moment, Mr. Flynt,” said Jinny, tendering a packet
as he started convoying the vet. “Your neckerchief!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neckerchief!” cried Martha. “And what about my new
bonnet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twas only to be cleaned,” Caleb reminded her. “And by
the same token, mother, don’t forget we settled the wet was to
read the letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes—I’ll get it.” And Martha hurried within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Jinny,” Caleb explained, “the missus got a letter
from Cousin Caroline, and we thought the gentleman here could
make one job of it with the pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why can’t I read it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ain’t married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more is Mr. Skindle.” Elijah flushed furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noa—but ef it’s too—too womanish, Oi’ll arx him kindly to
break it to me, sow Oi can break it to the missus when he’s gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the letter?” asked Jinny, as Martha reappeared
with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s her—came all of an onplunge,” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s not from your Cousin Caroline!” said Jinny, with
a thrill of excitement as she took it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noa?” gasped Caleb, as if the world was tumbling about
his ears. Then he smiled. “You’re making game—you ain’t
opened her yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who else is it from?” cried Martha, catching her excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see? It’s from Will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will!” Martha gave a great cry, and clutched at the
letter. “My baby Will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb scratched his head. “Now which would be Will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will was the freckled, good-looking one,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny,” said Martha. “They were all good-looking—took
after Flynt. Dear heart, you can’t ha’ forgotten our tot after
all that flurry. ’Tis only seven or eight years since he——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay,” cried Caleb. “Him what mowed the cat’s whiskers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear heart, that was Ben.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure. Ben’s the barber in New York—or some such
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Caleb. That’s Isaac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isaac? Then Will ’ud be the one what married the coffee-coloured
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you the other day that was Christopher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, him in Australia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Africa surely,” put in Elijah, puffing at his pipe with superior
amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They furrin places be much of a muchness,” said Caleb.
“And my buoy-oys were as like as a baker’s dozen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were girls in the batch,” corrected Martha. “But
how you can forget that dreadful Sunday night, you who snipped
the darling’s buttons——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I don’t see the pig soon,” interrupted Elijah, losing
patience, “the light’ll be gone altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll git a lantern,” said Caleb placidly. “Oi often used to
set and wonder how they lads knowed theirselves, the one from
the ’tother. Well, the Lord bless ’em all, says Oi, wherever they
goo, and whichever they be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you see,” said Jinny, with a faint blush hardly visible by
owl-light, “there’s no need to waste Mr. Skindle’s time over the
letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more there ain’t!” said Caleb dazedly. “Come along,
sir!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But Martha still clung strangely to the letter she had snatched
back. “You mustn’t strain your eyes, Jinny,” she said. “I’ll
light the lamp. And you’ll take a cup of tea first. You must
be tired out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can see quite well,” said Jinny. Indeed the sky,
despite the risen moon, remained blue, and splashes of dying
sunset burned magically through the yet empty branches of the
quiet trees. There was a great sense of space and peace and
beauty: a subtle waft from the stacks; the note of the thrush
was full of evening restfulness. Jinny took the letter from the
reluctant Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must be back in England!” she cried. “Look at the
stamp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha staggered against the cart. “It’s very good of God,”
she said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her emotion communicated itself to Jinny. Through misty
eyes the girl watched a solitary heron winging on high through
the great spaces, its legs sticking out like a tail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, dearie,” said Martha, recovering herself, “never forget,
to say your prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t,” said Jinny with equal simplicity. But she remembered
with fresh remorse that she had forgotten those for the
runaway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever since I was a little girl,” said Martha, “I’ve wanted to
please God. But of late, Jinny, I fear I’ve wanted Him to
please me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now He has,” said Jinny. “You’ll have Will as well
as Maria,” and plucking out a hairpin she inserted it to rip open
the loose wafer-closed envelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” cried Martha. “Suppose it’s bad news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, Mrs. Flynt! Look how firm the writing is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Firm—yes, he always was firm—even before he drove off
with the cart. Don’t you remember that night—no, ’twas
before your grandfather fetched you to these parts—he wasn’t
seven, but that pig-headed he sulked in the wood all night—roosted
up a tree like a bird, and never a move or a word when
we came halloaing with torches!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he’s not hiding now, for the postmark’s London
and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t open it yet, Jinny—suppose he should be married
like Christopher!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny laughed uneasily. “Two black daughters-in-law aren’t
very likely. Much more likely she’ll be blonde.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he can’t be married,” said Martha on reflection. “He
never could abide girls. I don’t mean you, dearie; you scarcely
had your second teeth, had you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny began to rip the envelope. “We shall soon see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martha snatched away the letter again. “I’m sure
you’ll spoil your pretty eyes,” she persisted. “Day-stars, Will
called ’em once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny laughed still more uneasily. “Then I ought to be able
to read by ’em. But I’ll light my night-star.” And she moved
towards the cart-lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t your lighting-up time yet, is it? You don’t want to
be wasteful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come in and light me a candle a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem in a great hurry to read it!” said Martha fretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me?” Jinny flushed furiously. “I thought you’d want
to hear what he says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I know what he says? That he is in England again
and coming to see his old mother? Isn’t that enough for one
night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a great deal, certainly. But suppose—he wants something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that’s true!” Martha was visibly perplexed. She did
not herself understand the suddenly awakened jealous instinct
that resented Jinny’s superior acquaintance with Will’s handwriting,
that was subconsciously urging her to hug this letter to
her bosom and not share its sacred contents with a girl she at
last—especially after Bundock’s recent innuendo—realized as
grown-up, and who seemed, moreover, to be claiming a co-proprietorship.
And so it was difficult for her to frame an
objection satisfactory to her conscious intelligence. But the
letter was now in her possession, and that was a strong asset for
her subconsciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis a pity to <span class='it'>tear</span> open such a beautiful envelope,” she said.
“You have your cup o’ tea. I’ll steam it over the kettle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I haven’t time for tea, especially having to take
Mr. Skindle a bit back,” said Jinny, almost as mystified as
Martha herself. “I’m late already, and Gran’fer will be roaring
for his supper. I must read it now or never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it was anything unpleasant,” wavered Martha, “Flynt
would be very upset. And after sitting up all night with Maria—no,
he must have a good sleep—better put it off till the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, I won’t be here. No, not till next Friday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve got to go to-morrow to Miss Gentry and she can
read it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Flynt wants to have my bonnet cleaned—vanity and
waste, I call it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But won’t that tire you—such a long walk? Why can’t I
take the bonnet to-night? I’ll be passing her house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We haven’t finished talking it over yet, Flynt and me,”
parried Martha. “I might be having a new bonnet, you see,
dearie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course, it’s just as you wish. But suppose it rains
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rains?” repeated Martha, feeling—she knew not why—like
an animal at bay. Then she drew a great breath of relief.
Footsteps and voices were borne towards them. “Caleb!” she
cried joyfully, “Will’s in London—he’s coming to see his old
mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good buoy-oy!” cried Caleb jovially. It was only what he
had expected the letter would say, but at heart he shrank from
the change—he had finally equated himself to the dual solitude,
and the home-coming prodigal loomed as menacing as Cousin
Caroline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good boy?” echoed Martha. “I should think he <span class='it'>is</span>—never
cared for girls. And still unmarried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a chance for you, Jinny,” chaffed Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how can you talk such nonsense!” Jinny was furiously
angry. “Basket, Nip,” she called sharply, and climbed up to
her seat almost as swiftly as he leapt into his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you coming, Mr. Skindle?” In her abstraction and to
busy herself about something, she automatically removed the
parcel of stones from the driving-seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a jiffy.” Elijah did not bound as obediently as Nip—he
could not lose the chance to pontificate before her. “Not at all
so well as you think, Mrs. Flynt. We experts can see what even
the breeder can’t. Keep her upon corn and peas—give her just
soft stuff.” And he vaulted not ungracefully to Jinny’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir,” said Martha, impressed. “Have you paid
him?” she inquired of Caleb in a formidable whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dedn’t Oi say Oi’d pay him for nawthen?” he answered still
more audibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, take off your hat for good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Oi ain’t inside,” said the obstinate, if confused,
Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny cracked her whip fiercely, and Methusalem joyously
turned his nose for home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Jinny. Thank’ee for reading Cousin Caroline’s
letter,” Caleb called after the receding vehicle.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was symptomatic of Jinny’s new mood that she scarcely
noticed that Mr. Skindle now shared her sacking. Her mind was
wandering again over the ground covered by the Sunday-school
wagon, and certain birds’ eggs, losing their later cloud of guiltiness,
lay suffused with childhood’s holy light. Methusalem went
unguided through quiet ways. The large, low moon, a pink
clown’s face, peered through leafless elms and gradually grew
golden. To the right of the winding road rooks cawed persistently,
and once a small flight flew towards the cart; to the left
more melodious birds whistled slow, high notes, or thrilled and
gurgled plaintively, or scurried off, startled, as the cart passed.
One kept on crying “Quick, quick, quick,” with a metallic sound
as of shears snipping the grass, but Methusalem was not to be
hurried. There was time to admire wherever a thatched cottage
made a picturesque point or a pond mirrored the dying sunset;
time to savour the subtle balm, where hayricks stood at the far
margin of fields. Sometimes a little pig would run round
terrified and finally squeeze itself under the fence, or a big
gander would stand and hiss. Sometimes the road narrowed to
a Gothic nave, but for the most part there was nothing but a far-diffused
sense of keen air and great flat spaces, the dark blue
circle of sky with rolling white clouds, the large green fields with
their distant border of thin trees; a view unclosed and unbounded
save by the horizon, though impalpably veiling itself as they
journeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah Skindle’s mood had changed no less than Jinny’s.
Though he now sat in the coveted proximity to her, and could
propose to her profile instead of her nape—and her bonnet was
of the narrow-flanked pattern, condemned by the more prudish
of her sex, that left the profile visible—he was subtly conscious
that he was really farther from her than before. Even when
the delivery of the few remaining parcels necessitated a slight
thawing on Jinny’s part, the whole spirit seemed to have gone
out of the adventure. It was grown tasteless as a thrice-warmed
dish. The very horn had lost its thrill. Even if he found a
vehicle at “The King of Prussia,” he was thinking, it would be
an expensive trip: they might charge him all Caleb’s half-crown.
He found himself morbidly counting the coils of cord—there
were five in all, he made out. And when the rooks he called
crows sailed towards him, they gave a still more sable hue to his
thoughts. He counted them, too, remembering how his peasant
mother—now installed as his woman-of-all-work—used to curtsy
to a solitary magpie, and the rhyme she taught him about the
crows: “One’s unlucky, two lucky, three is health, four is
wealth, five is sickness, and six is death.” Odd that matrimony
was not mentioned, unless it was included in “two.” There
were certainly five crows, he thought dismally—a sinister coincidence
with the coils of cord. Then, cheering up, he interpreted
the omened sickness as that of the local live-stock, a sickness
greater than Jorrow could cope with, and he reflected that after
all Jinny’s was a hard and toilsome life and her frigidity was
perhaps due to its never occurring to her that he was willing to
raise her to his status. Perhaps she thought he was just itching
to take liberties. Well, he could understand her coyness: other
men might indeed exploit such a chance; but he, he assured
himself again, was a gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a slow couple,” he said, boldly breaking the long
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me they fly as fast as the other rooks,” said
Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean the Flynts,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was resentment in her tone. She had not liked his
calling Caleb “Uncle,” understanding well the urban contempt
that lurked in declaring oneself a rustic’s nephew, and feeling,
too, that however slow in the uptake Caleb might be, his wealth
of homely crafts, knacks, instincts, life-wisdom, and nature-knowledge
gave him a richer and deeper quality than this pert
townsman. But Elijah persisted in his urban appraisal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No go in them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear old turtles!” sighed Jinny. “But so long as they go
at the same pace——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” he said eagerly. “You believe in like to like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, fancy a turtle married to a hare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a pair of hares now—?” He seized his opportunity.
“You and me, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak for yourself, Mr.—Bunny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m paying you a compliment, Jinny, classing you with me
for smartness. There isn’t a girl from Bradmarsh to Chipstone
that can hold a candle to you. So that’s why, seeing a man
must marry somebody sometime, and looking around as becomes
a man who’s getting a bit—a bit——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bald?” prompted Jinny blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what does that matter?” he said, too intent now to be
fobbed off by raillery. “The point is that with the practice and
position I’m getting now, it would be a good lift for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I was giving you a lift,” said Jinny icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you were—so you are—in that sense. But I didn’t need
even that. My nag wasn’t really lame. I only made an excuse
to talk this over. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very lame excuse,” flashed Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was never any way of talking to you—you always so
busy with parcels and me with patients. I’m not one of your
flirting kind with fancy waistcoats, I want to settle down, and
I’ve taken a favour to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even Jinny’s ready tongue had no repartee to this massive
complacency. She could only articulate: “Have you, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have. And I’d like to see you driving of a Sunday in
my smart trap. Come, what do you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” she said coldly. “I’d rather stay in my old
cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s such a shame—you so spruce and spry—tied to this
ramshackle cart, when you might be adorning a higher sphere
and sitting in my parlour instead of being at everybody’s beck
and call.”’</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had chosen precisely the worst form of appeal. Confronted
with this picture of parlour-stodginess, her rôle of Jinny the
Carrier—Jinny the pet and friend-in-need of the countryside—seemed
infinitely dear and desirable. And what subtly added to
her anger was some dim presentiment in herself of other forces
coming into her life, forces threatening to emerge from their
picture-past, and to trouble the placid current of her career.
Like Caleb she shrank from change. To shuttle for ever ’twixt
Bradmarsh and Chipstone; with her grandfather, Nip, Methusalem,
all immortal and unchanging as herself—this was all she
asked of heaven: this and not too much rain and wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want me to sit in your parlour?” she cried in white
revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took off his cap and bowed gallantly: “In silks and satins.”
Then suddenly realizing his baldness, he clapped it on again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And give up my work!” There was an ominous light in
Jinny’s eyes. But love is blind! Even the bats now beginning
to swoop in the dusk could see more clearly than Elijah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise you you shan’t do a stroke!” said the fatuous
young man. “As the wife of a veterinary surgeon, you’d be a
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what would become of Gran’fer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d have warm corduroys and plenty of gruel in the
Chipstone poorhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heartless knacker! Get off my cart. Whoa! Methusalem,
whoa!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you fly at a man! I’ve already got my mother living
with me, and she and your grandfather wouldn’t get on, being of
a different class. But I’d be willing to pay his rent and get a
woman to look after him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody shall look after him but me. And his business—who
is to look after that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry. Some other carrier’ll crop up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t going to be any other carrier here but Daniel
Quarles, understand that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you think you’ll find anybody to marry your grandfather——”
he said sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who wants to marry? I shall never give up the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re so fond of driving, there’s always my trap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No good setting traps for me. I’ll hang in a cage in no
man’s parlour. I must fly about in the woods like now—free!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Birds in the woods are sometimes hungry,” her wooer
reminded her. “Suppose your business falls off—or things go to
famine prices like five or six years ago. The gallon loaf ain’t
always a shilling. Ten years ago I remember flour was two and
ten the stone, and that only seconds, and tea was five shillings.
With me you’d be sure of the fat of the land always—there’s no
difference with me ’twixt Sundays and weekdays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s a stuffed bird you want for your parlour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish, I’ve got six stuffed birds in my parlour—in the
loveliest glass cases!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they don’t sing!” And Jinny burst mockingly into a
song that had hitherto been a mere tune to her:</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He lost his temper. “Oh, you needn’t make such a fuss over
yourself. I dare say I can find plenty of wives—with my
connexion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Among pigs?” she said sweetly. She jumped down and
began to light the lamp. “This is your getting-out place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nothing of the sort—I go on to the bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impossible. My horse is lame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know all about that.” And snatching up the reins she had
dropped, “Gee-up!” he called suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Methusalem knew better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never get home that way,” said Jinny, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how the hell——?” he began furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shanks’s mare,” she reminded him again. “That’s not
lame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave her a long, nasty look as though meditating the law
of the stronger. But he tried pleading first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the time I walk home, my mother’ll have locked up;
thinking I’m sitting up with a patient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the poorhouse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced. “You’ve got to carry me,” he said sullenly, “or
I’ll have the law on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no law to make me carry aught save goods.” And
she sang on carelessly:</p>

<p class='noindent'>The little voice, rippling through those demure lips, wellnigh
stung him to close her mouth with the masterful gag of kisses,
but a remnant of sanity warned him not to spoil a fine animal
practice by a scandal. Besides Jinny had her whip, and what
was still more formidable, her horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be even with you for this!” And jumping down, he
strode off furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo! Mr. Skindle! Hullo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep away from me!” It was at once an appeal and a
warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you want your case of instruments? Not that you’ll
be in time to kill those poor horses to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an unsmothered oath he turned back and clambered into
the interior, upsetting Nip’s basket in his fury; the result of
which neglect to let sleeping dogs lie was that the unsagacious
animal mounted growling guard over the instrument-case, as
before a burglar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d best get it for me,” he said sullenly. “And by the
way, how much do I owe you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” she said blandly, handing him his burden.
“You promised to be even with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little vixen!” he thought, as he trudged towards a farm
where he remembered doctoring a horse. “She ought to be put
in the ducking-pond! What a lucky escape!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Blackwater Hall</span>, the home of Daniel Quarles and his granddaughter,
was none of your old manor-houses with mullioned
windows and carven music-galleries, fallen in grandeur and rent.
It had barely done yeoman’s service, being just a low whitewashed
and thatched cottage, whose upper windows under the
overhanging eaves seemed deep-set eyes under jutting brows.
Nor was it near the Blackwater, though from its comparatively
high ground the broadening river first began to glimmer on the
view when you came to the edge of Bradmarsh Common and
looked across its brown expanse towards the bluish haze of the
background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in reality nearer the Brad, which as seen foreshortened
from it seemed to lave the roof of Frog Farm and sentinel it with
its willows. Blackwater Hall should in fact—Jinny would jest—have
been called Common Cottage. For it was just a way of
living on the Common, protected from the elements, yet sucked
up into them: a sort of transparent, transpirable shell amid this
universal flying, fluttering, hopping, creeping, crawling, soaring,
swooping, scampering, twisting, droning, humming, buzzing,
barking, chirping, croaking, cawing, and singing: a human nest
niched on the edge of a chaos of twigs, roots, old amorphous
trunks, tangled faded fern-branches, mossy patches, gorse,
ferruginous-leaved oaks, shrubs, ant-heaps innumerable, rabbit-warrens,
wild apple, wild plum, black heather, and endless stubs
to catch the feet, or branches to whip the face, or thorns to prick
the fingers. A garden path to the Hall lay between homely
flowers, periwinkle and marigold and the like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind the Hall lay the Quarles estate of an acre and a lug or
two, with its poultry-run, its tethered goats, its vegetables, its
clothes-lines, its thatched stables, its odd sheds and little barn,
and its well. If Daniel Quarles was not nid-nodding over his big
Bible or on the bench in the front porch, or pruning the vine
over the kitchen door, or exercising his lopping and topping
rights on the Common, it was here the nonagenarian was to be
found pottering: planting, hoeing, watering, or weeding. He
would usually groom Methusalem of a morning—it was his way
of asserting his hold over the business—and on Tuesday and
Friday evenings, when the wayworn Jinny drove up along the
grassy path ’twixt cottage and Common, rutted only from her
own wheels, he would generally rub down Methusalem after high
tea. Otherwise the multiform labour of house and land, of
cooking and bread-baking and goat-milking and scrubbing and
washing, all fell upon the little Carrier. And even the work the
Gaffer did was far outbalanced by the work he made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet it was Daniel’s personality, not Jinny’s, that was
impressed on the house, even as his name remained on the cart.
Her own exiguous claim upon life combined with piety and
affection to leave everything as she had found it when he brought
her here; not only in the big attic where eight had once huddled
and which he now occupied in solitary state, sadly conscious of
the great, snoreless silences, but in both the ground-floor rooms
over which it stretched. The one with the window was the
living-room, and the other—on which the front door opened
and where a Dutch clock with hanging weights greeted the
visitor with a cheery tick that relieved its deadness—was piled
pell-mell with old cypress chests and other-litter of the progeny
he had outlived, as well as with a few boxes or parcels left by
neighbouring clients or as yet undelivered to them. These two
rooms communicating, the box-room served both as a business
office and a passage to the living-room, from the rear of which
you ascended by a door the wriggling staircase to the patriarch’s
big bedroom, or tumbled down two steps from another doorway
to a combination of kitchen, larder, wood-cellar, and scullery, lit
up and aired by one small swinging pane, a den which even
Jinny could not keep free of cobwebs and smells. Here was the
Gaffer’s beer-barrel, and the thumb-hole tray, painted with tigers,
on which she brought in his morning draught from it. Here also
were the jug and basin of her toilette, for bedroom Jinny had
none; the need of disturbing the ancient chests or the office—which
would have been a sad blow to her grandfather—being
avoided through the fortunate talent of the chest of drawers in
the living-room for turning into a bed. Its drawers, in which
the bedding was concealed, would come out and hook on to
one another, while legs would swivel out from beneath them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not gay—this room-of-all-work—despite its over-population
of china shepherdesses with their swains and hounds
and its rank growth of dried grass in vases—all doubled and
distorted by the cracked, fustily gilt mirror on the mantelpiece—for
the oaken beams of the ceiling, from which hung a gigantic
rusty key, had been plastered over, and the walls—in a similar
quest of gentility—dulled with a grey paper, sedulously rematched
when it fell to pieces; far livelier was the staircase
paper—all hearts and roses—if only you could have seen it in
the dusky windings and under the menacing bulge of the plaster
ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from the shepherdesses and vases, among which Jinny
was not sorry to see a growing mortality, as the Gaffer fumbled
for his spectacles, the room was not over-furnished, a small
carved wooden settle by the cavernous hearth, a small square,
central table without flaps, two squat and cushioned arm-chairs,
with one prim wooden chair, and a little lamp with a monstrous
fat globe, constituting almost the minimum of necessaries; even
their united libraries, the Gaffer’s Family Bible and Jinny’s
“Peculiar Hymn-Book” and “Universal Spelling-Book,” being
constrained to repose, like the shepherdesses, on top of the chest
of drawers—that shifty piece of furniture whose mysterious
recesses secreted also the hymn-book recovered from the bushes.
That article of bigotry and virtue, hurled from him by the angry
boy, lay—long-forgotten—in the top drawer behind the rolled-up
wire mattress that uncoiled by a spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet this shabby room with its drab paper and squat furniture—vivified
most of the year only by that tireless tick of the Dutch
clock from the office, or the purring of the kettle from the kitchen—made
for Jinny the holy conception of home. The very cracks
in the mirror had become second nature; a glass that looked
one squarely in the face would have put her eye out, and if
in an utterly impossible moment the Gaffer had considerately
replaced the old one, the tresses she tamed into seemliness by it
would have been a sorry sight. Here, without books or friends,
mere living was a happiness, especially at night after Gran’fer,
whose big Bible invariably turned from a table-book into a
pillow, had woke up and remarked he was getting sleepy, and
been steered up the corkscrew staircase to his bed. Then, in a
silence broken by no human sound—save the snoring of the
Gaffer from above—and in a security symbolized by the unlocked
gates and doors, Jinny would sit in delicious relaxation with her
sewing or knitting or bonnet-trimming, finding compensation for
the long laborious day: listening in summer to the late singing
birds or gazing in winter at the glowing logs with their delicate
flicker of blue, while Nip in his virtuous basket snored in harmony
with the Gaffer or uttered joyous yells in his dream-hunting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those hours Jinny demanded nothing of man or God,
though when she had produced her bed like a conjurer out of its
mahogany recesses, prayers came automatically to the sleepy
little figure kneeling beside it, with the dark hair flowing over
the white shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a pretty sight, but only the cracked mirror saw it.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Yet back, deep back in Jinny’s baby consciousness, lay
another home altogether, a home richer in comfort and love;
giving not on a tumbling common, but on a strange, flat waterside—with
stately dream-ships in swelling white, and black
barges, and little boats with ochre or orange sails, and a pervading
savour of salt and mud; the real Blackwater Hall she felt dimly,
though its name escaped her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this overlaid life there was a filmy female figure that fed
and bathed and rocked one, and kissed the place one had banged,
and sometimes held one as passionately as if against some monster
that was trying to tear one’s face from that flower-soft cheek; it
could scarcely be that burly figure, spasmodically appearing and
disappearing, for that too was kind in its different way, and had
a knee less cumbered by clothes across which one could ride
astride, and pullable hair on its face and curling smoke issuing
from its mouth more profusely than from the kettle’s. Out of
this general background, like mountains from a plain, stood out
a few episodes of peculiar vividness, but of no apparent significance—in
one she sat on a rough sea-wall playing with innumerable
tiny white shells while a bird hovered over her crying,
as if trying to induce her to follow it seaward, but before she
could do so the female figure had appeared, frantically scolding
and caressing, and had carried her, struggling and kicking, back
to a cot. In another she was carried by the burly being to a
little room with a strange little bulbous window and a queer
smell, where she was kissed by an elderly figure with a cocked
hat and a fixed eye that had a strange affinity to the window.
Later she seemed to be living in the strange building that held
this room: it had a canvas roof, a flag at one end and a mast
with ropes at the other, yet puzzlingly was not a ship, for she
saw herself running down the stairs to pat Methusalem in the
road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these shadowy and usually submerged images all leapt
into renewed vitality one delectable Wednesday when, clad in a
new black dress, hurriedly stitched together by Miss Gentry, she
divided the driving-board with her grandfather (looking odd in
his white funeral smock beside her blackness), while Methusalem,
equally refreshed and exhilarated by the novel roads, almost
hurried them by square-towered hamlets and dear little bridges
spanning crawling streams to the quaint cemetery where the old
man’s sister was to lie. How Nip would have loved the expedition
she thought in after days! But he had not yet adopted
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on this trip that she began to hear things that solidified
the filmy figures—but it was only from the Gaffer’s spasms of
imprecation tailing off into anecdote that she was able in the
course of years to piece together her parental history. Boldero,
she learnt incidentally, was her real name, not Quarles: a
correction that mattered less, since nobody had ever called her
anything but Jinny. She gathered that the Gaffer had purposely
neglected to perpetuate her father’s name: he was cancelled
and annulled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Boldero, she came gradually to understand, was one of
those superior souls of uncertain status who, having got command
of a little sailing vessel, were wafted joyously to and fro, exchanging
the silks and spirits of France and the tobacco of Holland
for the coins of England without any regard for the benighted
principles handicapping human intercourse by taxation. Although
her father finally came to own the cargoes he ran, he was
at first the mere carrier for speculative capitalists; under cover,
moreover, of an honest freight of non-dutiable articles. Carrying
was thus in Jinny’s blood, both by land and sea, and it is no
marvel she made a success of it. But the conjuncture of the two
bloods came by the queerest of accidents. The <span class='it'>Tommy Devil</span>—the
fearsome name of Roger Boldero’s boat was only the Essex name
for the swift that flew gigantically in gay wood over its cutwater—being
caught one night in a sudden gale at a season of high
tides, found herself driven towards a lee shore of her native
county. It was a perilous situation, and rather than be dashed
on the beach broadside on, Skipper Boldero put his helm up and
daringly essayed to land nose first on the mud. But the lugger,
whose lightness was so admirable against the King’s cutters, and
which had been still further lightened of her ankers of brandy
and stone bottles of Schiedam—these, through an interruption
by the blockade men, “waiting to be called for” in certain
“fleets” and ditches farther along the coast—could not keep
her head against the veering welter. With desperate resourcefulness
Boldero improvised a drogue by lashing spars and a
spare sail to a rope and trailing it at the stern, and, thus steadied
before the wind, the <span class='it'>Tommy Devil</span> escaped broaching to, and
despite the following sea that tilted her figurehead into the
depths, she was finally dumped high and wet on the beach, on
the very verge of the sea-wall—both uninjured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fine piece of seamanship (though aided by the rare steepness
of this bit of beach and the high water), and the storm beginning
to abate and the water to recede, the sails were lowered and
the skipper and crew turned thankfully in. They were not wanting
in men—carrying of this kind needed large and able-minded
crews—yet all hands being worn out by hours of battling with
wind and wave—“dilvered,” as old Daniel put it—a watch was
deemed superfluous for a vessel no longer at sea, and the <span class='it'>Tommy
Devil</span> reposed from stem to stern with all the soundness of
conscious virtue watched over by Providence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it happened that Lieutenant Dap, commander of His
Majesty’s Revenue Cutter, then prowling in the offing in quest
of gin-tubs—he had been pressed as a youth, served under
Nelson, and had exchanged to the Preventive Service when he
married that rustic beauty Susannah Quarles, sister of Daniel—was
returning with a lantern at the first peep of dawn to the
“Leather Bottel,” to knock up his boat’s crew. His anxious day
in Brandy Hole Creek—as everybody called the little place—had
ended happily: Susannah’s seventh baby had been safely and
punctually launched—and the proud and prolific father was
anxious to be back sweeping up the prizes that led to preferment.
It being a high occasion, and to impress Mrs. Dap’s
neighbours, he had come ashore in a cocked hat, and he felt
almost knocked into one when he beheld, towering over the sea-wall,
the great masts of a vessel that loomed gigantic in that
place and light. He rubbed his one eye—the other he had lost
in his original struggle against the pressgang—but the mysterious
jetsam remained, and a closer inspection showed it the kind of
longish craft whose huge lugsails his clumsier man-o’-war could
rarely overtake, despite his square sail yards. But boldly, as
befitted a man with a Nelsonic eye, and without waiting even to
summon his men, he hailed the stranded stranger. No reply.
Nor did even a shower of such small stones as the muddy beach
afforded have any effect on the uncanny bark. There was
nothing left but to board her—which the hero achieved single-handed,
clambering over the sagging bulwark and standing alone
on the slanting deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Boldero, aroused to find himself challenged by the
cocked hat and stony eye of the Law, displayed, though blinking
at the lantern, as great a sang-froid as in the presence of the
elements. There was, in fact, far less danger. Of the forbidden
articles only lace was left on board, and lace has been designed
by the said watchful Providence to occupy small space and be
easily invisible. A wink to his second in command, and two of
the crew who were in excess of the legal number for that small
tonnage, smuggled themselves overboard—here being one of the
advantages of <span class='it'>terra firma</span>. The few odd kegs, flagons, and
cigar-boxes were the ship’s own stores Boldero maintained, and
he would be very glad if the “Commodore” would join him in
sampling them now. Softened by the title, the bold Dap
nevertheless declined: the vessel was his prize, he declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is to prevent us taking <span class='it'>you</span> as our prize?” asked
Roger blandly, having by now discovered that Dap was alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t move an inch,” said Dap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we shall float off as soon as the tide rises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely. But it won’t come as high again, not till the next
spring tide. Meanwhiles I’ve a gig’s crew ashore and a cutter
within gunshot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boldero was taken aback. He realized that he was—in
nautical parlance—“neaped.” What a miserable misadventure!
What a reward for his seamanship! But, masking his consternation,
he rejoined with a smile, “Then you can’t take your prize
in tow either.” He proceeded to point out laughingly that there
was no question of capture on either side, that there was not a
tittle of evidence against him, that he was an honest trader, as
his manifest and cargo would show—and that even if His Majesty,
through his admirable if over-zealous representative, insisted on
taxing his own little modicum of alcohol and tobacco, it had not
been technically landed. The nice point whether a cargo which
lands inside its ship instead of outside can be said to have landed,
side-tracked the question of the status of the ship herself, and
entailed so great a consumption of the cheroots and liquor—despite
the unearthly hour—that their fiscal value must have
been considerably reduced. But the obdurate Dap still insisting
they were dutiable, Roger Boldero invited him to seal them up
till he sailed, as he had certainly no intention of landing them
here. He pointed out, however, that though the tide, like Time,
waited for no man, he would have to wait for the tide; and that
during this disagreeable interval the hope of again offering the
“Commodore” the cordial, if lop-sided, hospitality of his cabin
must disappear if the fomenters of friendship were put in bond.
Even this argument might have shattered itself against Dap’s
fuddled sense of duty had not the twice aforesaid Providence
now sent on board a rival cocked hat with a feather salient. With
the growing light the local exciseman—of the shoregoing branch
of the service—had likewise discovered the strange quarry. But
the gleam in the hunter’s eye died when Lieutenant Dap introduced
him to his friend Boldero, who was celebrating with him
the birth of his seventh baby, and whose society for the next
month would, he was sure, add to the amenities of life in Brandy
Hole Creek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And “my friend Boldero” did not fail to become it, for
Lieutenant Dap’s cruising was confined to the waters on whose
border he had built his nest: and he was frequently hove to.
And during those tedious four weeks, made still more tedious by
rain, Boldero had himself rowed out more than once to the
“Channel groper” whose black hull, copious white boats,
formidable guns and flaming-flannelled red-capped crew were
plainly visible from the beached lugger; and he moved genially
among the blue-trousered tars and did full justice to the Lieutenant’s
gin-toddy and had his fingers often in the Lieutenant’s
snuff-box and lent a sympathetic ear to his methods and devices
against those rascally smugglers with their manœuvre of rowing
dead to windward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their spirit-casks were slung with ropes, the Lieutenant
explained, so that their confederates on shore could load them
easily on their horses, but only the other night the blockade-men
had discomfited a formidable shore-gang of fifty who, despite
their stout ashpoles, had been unable to carry off anything
except their wounded. He would have caught the lugger, too,
had she not kept doubling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commander of the amphibious <span class='it'>Tommy Devil</span> even shared
in an exciting, if unsuccessful, chase after a suspicious landing-party,
going out with a galley-crew in a rain-storm in a borrowed
tarpaulin petticoat. And once the one-eyed hero—who felt
himself none the less a Nelson because his eye had been lost in
resisting entry into the navy—returned Roger Boldero’s visit,
and after broaching sundry of the happily unsealed kegs, the
two skippers repaired arm in arm—the attitude was necessary—to
see the seventh baby and present the fond mother with
material for a lace cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now while Daniel Quarles’s sister had been lying as helpless
as the lugger, his last unmarried daughter, Emma, a beauty still
more engaging, was housekeeping for Aunt Susannah and minding
the other four children (two were dead). She had come in Daniel
Quarles’s cart, and her father was to fetch her again as soon as
Susannah was up (or down). He should already have come for
her, but the rains had made such glue of the roads that a queerly
spelt letter came instead, saying he would wait till they hardened.
This delay, brief as it was, sufficed to bring the neaped mariner
under the spell of the landlocked village maid, so sweet to look
on, so serviceable about a house, and so motherly with a baby
that the novel thought of matrimony was popped into a rover’s
head. She, for her part, was still more swiftly subjugated by
the jolly Roger and the <span class='it'>Tommy Devil</span>, and the mutual confession
was precipitated by the opposite menaces of tide and cart, each
threatening to bear them apart. It was a race between these
and the course of true love, which must flow rapid to flow at
all. But it did not flow smooth, for when Daniel Quarles arrived
to convey his daughter home and found a rival vehicle waiting
uncouthly on the beach to bear her off, he roundly damned the
“furriner” who aspired to be his son-in-law, and he included in his
maledictions the Preventive Service and all its works, especially
the new baby, not to mention the times and the tides. For
though he had long ago found grace and become a Wesleyan, he
had embraced the new doctrine with the old robustiousness. The
natural man was no more to be mitigated than a hedgehog. Had
he become a Quaker, he would have turned the other cheek in
a violent collision with the striker’s jaw. He enjoyed being
angry, and that his wrath was “righteous” only added to its
zest. And “righteous” it now was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trouble was not that Captain Boldero was a Churchman:
the fellow was flippantly ready to embrace anything on earth
that included Emma. It was not even that Daniel “suspicioned”
him a smuggler. Smuggling—even if you had a brother-in-law
in the Government—was quite as respectable as poaching, and
in days when the rural labourer could not have lived had he not
eked out his obolus by occasional rabbits (with the necessary
vegetables), only an obtuse squirearchy could hold that sinful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even the squire had no opprobrium for the smuggler:
gentry and peasantry were at one in backing up the manly
patriot who thwarted a wicked Government, supplied Britons
with the cup that cheers and their country with a fine naval
reserve and early information of Froggy’s movements. The
shores of Essex as of all Britain were honeycombed—apart from
their large natural resources and their ruins and haunted houses—with
artificial hiding-places, cellars, vaults, and secret passages,
and every man’s hand was against the Ishmael of the Customs
House. Farmers left their gates open at night to facilitate the
cavalcades and coaches-and-six, and were but little surprised to
find tea or tobacco coming up overnight on their fields like
mushrooms. Even parsons were disposed to regard such treasures
as drifted their way as heaven-sent flotsam, and Government
circles themselves—in that era of purchasable votes and votable
purchases—had not the ethical toploftiness which characterizes
all Governments to-day. No, it was not Boldero the Smuggler,
but Boldero the Smoker that found himself hurled into outer
darkness the day poor shrinking Emma was borne off in her
father’s cart. “No puffing pirate shall cross <span class='it'>my</span> threshold,”
swore Daniel, but the accent was on the puffing, not the pirate.
For tobacco had become tabu in the Wesleyan ranks: the
godless practice of smoking was formally forbidden to the
ministers. Swiss Protestantism indeed had once included its
prohibition in the Ten Commandments. If Methodism did not
thus re-edit the Decalogue, its horror of the abomination was no
less keen, and a change of practice being always easier than a
change of heart, Daniel Quarles had poured a deal of spiritual
energy into the sacrifice of his pipe. The “rapscallion Boldero,”
he declared, not only sinned himself, but was the cause of sin
in others, trafficking as he did in the unholy weed. If Emma
insisted on a “smoker,” wasn’t there the miller at Long Bradmarsh,
he inquired with grim facetiousness, meaning that the
grotesque Griggs had a vote by living in a house with a chimney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Emma for all her gentle airs had proved “obstropolus.”
She had discovered that Susannah’s husband smoked as prodigally
as Roger—though it had been hidden from the old man on
his rare visits—and that so far from bedevilling men, tobacco
tended to angelicize them. Would indeed that her father haloed
himself with these clouds! Besides, she shrewdly suspected
that even a Wesleyan archangel, appearing suddenly as a suitor,
would have fared similarly, and that the smoke was only a cover
for a wish to keep his last girl. And so, though the lover was left
lamenting, and the <span class='it'>Tommy Devil</span> duly floated off without the lass,
it was not long that Emma was left stranded in Blackwater Hall.
With a parent removed by Providence every Tuesday and
Friday, even the flabbiest female may be stiffened, and the end
was smuggled matrimony; though very soon the blessing of a
minister brought Methodism into their madness. Roger Boldero
not only became a Wesleyan like his wife and her father, but was
one of the first Dissenters to be married in their own chapel by
their own clergy under the new Act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The odd union had turned out happy, but with one dismal
drawback—the Bolderos could not rear children. They fared
worse even than the Bidlakes, and with no such obvious reason.
One hapless infant after another died, and when at last, in their
late middle years, little Jinny was safely steered through three
winters, it was they who were taken as if in lieu of their progeny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair had finally settled down by the same waterside that
had united them—the attractions of “Brandy Hole Creek”
having been enhanced by the perpetual presence of their relative
by marriage, Commander Dap, who with the subsidence of spirit
duties and smuggling had found his mobile cutter replaced by
the moored “Watch Vessel 23.” Here with Susannah and his
children and five satellites (and <span class='it'>their</span> wives and families) the
veteran lived in domestic beatitude under the title of Chief
Coast Guard Officer. High on the beach, and boarded by a
commodious staircase, the houseboat seemed a standing reminder
of the adventure of the <span class='it'>Tommy Devil</span>. Under its challenging
eye, that adventurous bark had sailed out and home, till that
last fatal voyage when the lugger foundered almost within sight
of a little Sussex port, which for weeks after was mysteriously
littered with washed-up tobacco-bales. Though Roger Boldero
was rescued, it had been the beginning of the end of his prosperity,
already undermined by the diminution of duties, and
a few years later both he and Emma were dead simultaneously
of smallpox. Again the carrier’s cart must fare to the Creek to
fetch the penniless little orphan, and there—soon after Will
Flynt’s flight—Daniel brought her back for the burial of his
sister Susannah. It was what buried Will’s memory too and
replaced him in her prayers by a new being, conceived as her
“Angel Mother.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The moment she saw and smelt the creek she knew she had
carried it in her soul all along: the white hut with its flagged
mast, the great Watch Vessel, the tumble of cottages, sheds,
barrels, pecking fowls, grubbing black pigs, recumbent ladders,
discoloured boats with their keels upwards, black rotting barges,
and rigged smacks stranded on hard steep mud. The sea came
in sluggishly through a broad green chine, half slime, half green
water, spitted with gaunt encrusted poles to mark the channel.
The water seemed even wider than she remembered, and yet
not so wide, for it was split by an island or a promontory that
gave a second sail-dotted expanse between her and the farther
shore. She yearned now towards that ultimate hump of hazy
woodland, and it was to remain for ever bathed in the quiet
beauty which wrapped it around as Methusalem toiled up to the
“Leather Bottel.” They were to stay the night there, for Daniel
would have none of the Commander’s hospitality, he being still
unforgiven. Besides, the child might be afraid of the corpse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was while sitting on that sea-wall with the octogenarian that
evening, her great grown-up fingers toying once again with tiny
white shells that strewed its top, and pewits again trying to lead
her from their young, that she first heard in broken outlines
how these waters had washed her into being. Something, too,
she gleaned from her refound relative-in-law, the chief mourner,
whose cocked hat, tattooed arm and genial senescence—not to
mention his house-boat—were one of the pleasantest impressions
or re-impressions of the funeral; and whose fascinating trick
of rolling one eye while the other was fixed in a glassy stare
almost made the child lose the sense of what he was saying. The
death of his wife had reminded the veteran of the death of
Nelson—nearly forty years before—and his tremulous tones grew
still shakier as he recalled how the flags over the hut and the
Watch Vessel and every other flag in England had flown at
half-mast, though of course there were more joyous aspects of
“Trafalgar” to be celebrated in bottles of Bony’s own brandy.
He frankly admitted he had himself been “three sheets in the
wind”—an image of bed-linen fluttering on a clothes-line that
long puzzled her. He took her abaft the Watch Vessel—it was a
way of leaving Daniel Quarles alone with his dead sister—and
recounted his astonishment at seeing her father’s boat spued up
like Jonah out of the whale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A handsome man,” he told her to her pleasure. But he
spoilt it all by adding, “though he would talk the hind leg off
a dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But wasn’t that cruel?” the little girl faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dap laughed. “He never did it really, dearie, and if the leg
<span class='it'>had</span> come off, he’d have helped the lame dog over a stile. And
so many lingos—parleyvooing in French and swearing in Double
Dutch. I don’t wonder your angel mother fell in love with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My angel mother!” echoed Jinny excitedly. “Was my
mother an angel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The veteran was taken aback. For a child who must be past
nine such primitiveness was startling. He had spoken loosely,
hardly knowing whether he alluded to Emma’s present heavenly
abode or to her sweet-temperedness on earth. He did not know
that little Jinny read nothing but literature in which angels
were a common feature of the landscape, and that Miss Gentry
had not measured her for her blacks without dwelling on her
own stained-glass specimen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was as pretty as one,” said the Commander after an
instant, “and now she <span class='it'>is</span> one.” Thus it was that Jinny’s mother,
already felt as a hovering sweetness, took on definite wings, and
even when Jinny’s maturer experience amputated them from her
earthly existence, they were what she still hovered over her
child with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Susannah and she’ll make a pair now,” he added, feeling
suddenly disloyal to the corpse at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Susannah?” queried Jinny, for her grandfather had been
calling his sister “Pegs”—“poor Pegs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother’s aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a new idea, an angel’s aunt. She saw the twain flying,
Susannah sailing with more sweeping pinions, her mother softly
rustling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The funeral was in style, and Jinny helped to set out the
refreshments in the saloon. There was some dispute as to whether
her grandfather could join the grand procession in his tilt-cart,
but though he urged that squires were proud to be buried from
farm-wagons, he consented to ride—like a fish out of water—inside
a mourning-coach, and not even on the box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Commander and Jinny shared his dismal grandeur, she
sitting bodkin though there was an empty seat opposite, which
“the seventh baby” had been expected to occupy. But Toby
had not arrived from his ship—he was a gunner—in time, and
the earlier progeny were still more scattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widower held his handkerchief in his fist, but owing to the
heat of a discussion on the manner the Navy had gone to the
dogs—or returned from them—since the Admiralty had set up
a gunnery school on a Portsmouth ship, he used it only to mop
his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellent, indeed!” He was mocking at the ship’s name.
“The ruination of the sarvice I tell you. It all comes from
doing away with the pressgang—stands to reason they picked
out the finest chaps—” here the Gaffer snorted—“Oh you may
sniff, but for fighting you want guts and muscle. Look what
England was in them days and what she is coming to now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To my lookin’-at-it-an’-thinkin’-o’t-too”—the Gaffer made
one breathless word of it—“ ’tis a blessin’ to be riddy of all them
gaolbirds, swearers, drinkers, smokers, and fornicators.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” The Commander tried to wink his glass eye
towards Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She don’t understand. Oi remember, the year my good-for-nawthen
Gabriel smashed up a threshin’-machine (and the poor
farmer dedn’t git no compensation neither, though ef his furniture
had been smashed ’twould have come on the Hundred) that wery
same year Ebenezer Wagstaff—for ’twas the coronation year of
King William, Oi remember, just afore my Emma desarted
me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a Sailor King,” interrupted Dap, half to stave off
fulminations against Jinny’s dead mother. “Began as middy
under Cap’n Digby in the unlucky <span class='it'>Royal George</span>—a ninety-eight
gun ship she was——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye put me off the track, drat ye, aldoe it leads back to
Ebenezer Wagstaff all the same, seein’ as the Prince might ha’
rubbed showlders with a thief as was sentenced for stealin’ half-a-suvran
from a barge on the Brad. He could ha’ been hanged
for it in them days, mind you—the case bein’ as clear as day or
rather as black as night. But they marcifully brought him in
guilty to stealin’ nine and ’levenpence and that saved his neck,
being a navigable river, and the judge give him the option of
gaol or jinin’ the Navy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a proper thing too. Set a thief to catch a Frenchy, and
him used to taking prizes by water. Nowadays before the
captain hoists his pennant he’s got a crew dumped on him that’s
no choice of his—mealy-mouthed lubbers, full of book-larnin’,
who don’t know a brigantine from a topsail schooner: it’s the
red ensign that gets all the good stuff, not the white. You mark
me, it’ll be the downfall of England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“England’ll never fall down while she’s got God-fearin’ congregations,”
maintained Daniel Quarles, and Jinny’s devout
little heart thrilled to hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the pleasant sunny graveyard there were apiaries and a
dismantled tower almost smothered by blackberry-bushes, and
the tombs and gravestones passed imperceptibly into a garden
of monkey-trees and weeping willows. These wrought in her no
stirring of memories, but as she had got off the coach, the standing
church tower, square and ivy-wrapped, had composed beautifully
with ricks of all sorts, with trees, old tiles, and thatch, into a
picture that seemed as much hers as the waterside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parson—Susannah had remained a Churchwoman—was
some minutes late, and Jinny was gratified to note how strong
her grandfather was: how pillar-like he stood in his long black
mourner’s cloak under the weight of the coffin at the churchyard
gate, while all the other bearers, his obvious juniors, shifted and
sweated. Nor did he blubber either like the Commander, whose
weakness, considering how often she had been adjured to be
“spunky,” and not—now that she was “grown up”—to cry,
was as disconcerting as the double existence of his wife in the
coffin and the empyrean. However, Dap grew “good” again
when the thrilling if still more disconcerting episode of lowering his
Susannah as far as possible from the skies and banking her safely
against ascent, was over; and—Daniel Quarles having gone
vaguely roving over the churchyard—the widower led her
stealthily in his absence to a stone behind the ruined tower—in
the “unconsecrated” or Dissenting area—and read to her
the inscription, following it for her confirmation with his black-gloved
forefinger:</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Here Lies Roger Boldero</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>After Many Stormy Voyages</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Safely Neaped in Christ.</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>He arrested himself suddenly and whisked her round the tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we didn’t read it all,” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it only says: ‘And also Emma Boldero, Wife of the
Above.’ But don’t tell your grandfather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child wondered why she was to keep Emma’s relationship
to the Above a secret—she had already gathered from her
grandfather that he knew it—and she was distressed as well as
puzzled at the strange quarrel that broke out in the homeward
coach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t at all a proper word,” said Daniel Quarles. “You
might as well put ‘carted to Christ’ on mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be your affair,” persisted the widower, “but this
ain’t. And how you came to see it gets over me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gaffer flushed uneasily. “Oi’ve got two eyes, I suppose,”
he jerked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The naval veteran glared glassily. “Them that pay the
piper call the tune,” he retorted defensively. “Besides,” he
added more gently, “Emma always said she’d have it somehow
on her tombstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emma was a silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” Dap again indicated the child with his glassy eye,
now trickling without the other as in half-mourning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi won’t hush it up. That’s got to goo. The mason’s got
to cut another for me. Who arxed you to pay pipers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a handsome stone to be torn up! It’s a desecration,
it’s unlawful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unlawful? Whose darter is she, mine or yourn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yours. You cut her off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She cut me off. And ef poor Pegs and you had done your
duty by my gal, he’d ha’ never crossed your doorstep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d ha’ met her on the sea-wall. I couldn’t help his
beholding her looks, any more than you could help having a
handsome daughter—or for the matter of that, a handsome
sister.” His handkerchief came out again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’m not denying their looks—a man with half an eye could
see that. ’Tis just the handsome gals as seems to throw theirselves
away,” he added musingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they are unhappy at home,” suggested the widower,
with equal philosophic aloofness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or in the housen they stays at,” assented the Gaffer. “But
let bygones by bygones. It may be the Lord dumped him down
for our good. All Oi say is, that word’s got to goo. A Churchman
may not see the blasphemy, but think o’ what John Wesley
would ha’ said to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d ha’ said ’twas a wicked extravagance to waste such a
fine stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mason’ll take it back. Happen there’ll be another
Roger Boldero dead and neaped some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely,” sneered the veteran. “And also an Emma,
Wife of the Above.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” The little maid nudged him, wondering he should
forget his own monition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That has more sense than you!” cried the Gaffer in high
glee. “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings!” And
drawing the astonished Jinny to his bristly beard, he kissed her
lips with a hearty smack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite these half-understood discords, Jinny was very sorry
to leave the stony-eyed veteran and the motley waterside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes,” she confided to the more sympathetic swivel
eye, as her grandfather was harnessing Methusalem for their
return, “I wish I had never come to earth at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Dap was startled by her simplicity—had not Daniel been
telling him what a useful little body she was in the business?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then you’d never have had your grandfather—or me,”
he said, stroking her cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have had God—and my angel mother!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Noa, arter she run away with her Boldero Oi’d never cross
her doorstep, never,” confessed the old carrier, picking up the
story later, as she rode beside him on their day’s work. He
was getting so old now that he preferred to talk of twenty rather
than of two years before, and the veneer of book-education
which his unexpected inheritance of the business had necessitated
had fallen away, and he was speaking more and more in the
idioms of his illiterate youth, curiously tempered at times by
the magnificent English of his Bible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that was wicked!” said Jinny decisively. She felt it
wrong indeed that a father should thus cut off his daughter, but
to have done this when that daughter was an angel (even if only
in the making), still more when that daughter was her own
mother, seemed to her confused consciousness the climax of
iniquity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wicked! The contrairy! Oi’d taken my Bible oath never
to set foot over her doorstep. So Oi dedn’t have no chance, you
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was silenced. She herself had succumbed to an oath,
and that indeed on a less awful book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arter she had lost two childer,” he went on, “and the third
got measles, she sent a man on hossback to beg me to take off
the spell. Thought, d’ye see, dearie, that for her frowardness
and disobedience Oi’d laid a curse on ’em all. Like one of our
Methody preachers, the chap seemed, with all the texts to his
tongue’s tip, and pleaded that wunnerful he ’most made me
believe Oi did have the evil eye. But though of course Oi
hadn’t no more to do wi’ the deaths of your little brothers and
sisters than a babe unborn—or you yourself, for the matter o’
that, as <span class='it'>was</span> a babe unborn—Oi couldn’t break my oath and
goo and pretend to cure the wean, and so when the measles
turned to pneumonia and it died, she got woundily distracted,
and writ me two sheets sayin’ as Oi was a child-murderer. That
didn’t worrit me no more than the child’s death, seein’ as the
Lord does everything for the best, though Oi had to pay double
on the letter. But one fine arternoon the preachin’ chap comes
again and says she’d been layin’ paralysed-like for a month and
wouldn’t Oi come and forgive her afore she kicked the bucket!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Gran’fer!” Jinny protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’m givin’ you <span class='it'>his</span> words,” said the Gaffer defensively.
“At least that was the meanin’, though ’haps he put it different,
me not havin’ his gift o’ the gab. But bein’ never a man to
nuss rancour, when folks own up, Oi said that even ef Oi could
forgive my darter, never could Oi enter a house harbourin’ that
rascal Boldero——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Gran’fer!” she protested again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no call to bristle up—he wasn’t your father yet.
‘But Boldero ain’t at home, he’s off on a jarney,’ says the chap.
‘D’ye swear that?’ says Oi. ‘By God, Oi will,’ says he. ‘Then
od rabbet, Oi’ll goo,’ says Oi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” urged Jinny, “if you had taken your oath——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wait till Oi’ve broke it! Oi knew ’twould be dead o’
night by the time Oi got to Brandy Hole Crick and Oi made him
swear too he wouldn’t let on to a soul, partic’ler to that rascal
Boldero or my sister Pegs and her cock-eyed son of a cocked hat;
and off we scuttles in a twinklin’, him on his hoss and me on
mine——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Methusalem?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noa, Jezebel. Methusalem and you wasn’t born yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were we both in heaven, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hosses don’t come from heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From where then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From stables o’ course. And you should see them two
animals gallopin’ like hell. ’Twas a race for the Crick. We
went down this wery road like fleck and turned off by the
smithy——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who won?” asked Jinny breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He hadn’t a chance, his hoss bein’ that winded already, and
him a heavyweight; Oi had the best part of an hour with your
mother afore he crossed the doorstep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could you break your Bible oath?” persisted Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He chuckled. “Oi dedn’t cross her doorstep. Oi’d sworn not
to, and a Quarles never breaks even his plain word, bein’ a forthright
family. ’Twas gettin’ on to bull’s-noon and like pitch, but
Oi could see her bedroom above by the light in it, and up Oi
climbs on Jezebel’s back and lifted myself up by the sill and got
my knee acrost it and pushed open the casement. Lord, how
she screamed! Up she flew from her dyin’-bed—no more
paralysis or sich-like maggots and molligrubs Oi warrant you!”
And his chuckle broadened into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was strangely relieved. “Then she didn’t die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could she die, silly, when you wasn’t there yet? Od
rabbet, wasn’t your feyther flabbergasted to see her up and
bobbish and me holdin’ her hand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father! But he was on a journey!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to me, the great ole sinner. You ain’t guessed ’twas
him with the gift o’ the gab? But no more did Daniel Quarles,
never conceivin’ a sailor on hossback and him swelled in the
stomach with prodigal livin’ since the day he diddled Pegs’s
husband and tried to diddle me out o’ my darter. But Oi’ll do
him the justice to say he never did blab to the Daps about my
comin’—and no more dedn’t your mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s hand sought her grandfather’s, though through the
whip-handle in his she could only secure a finger. “But why
should you hide your goodness, Gran’fer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twasn’t no goodness, only nat’ral, Emma bein’ punished
and chastised enough from on high. Why, if Pegs and her false-eyed
mannikin’d a-got wind as we’d made it up, Emma and me
and Roger, they’d ha’ come to think they was in the right arter
all, lettin’ Emma be kidnapped by a furriner. And that ’ud ha’
been the last straw. As ill luck would have it Dap come knockin’
there that wery dead o’ night, he havin’ just come home from a
trip and heard from Pegs as her niece was dyin’. Oi shan’t
soon forgit the start Oi got at that knockin’, all on us settin’ so
hearty at supper, and Emma in her scarlet dressin’-gownd, smart
as a carrot. Noigh quackled Oi was, with the brandy gooin’ the
wrong way. Your feyther he goes to the door with his face full
o’ lobster and sputters through the crack as they’d got a new
doctor who was operatin’ on her and wery ’opeful.” He chuckled
again. “And Oi count ’twas a better doctor than any in Brandy
Hole Crick, for wery soon there was a new baby—though that
died too, Oi’m thankful to say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You aren’t!” The little listener loosed his finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Oi am, dearie.” He cracked his whip. “Otherwise
wouldn’t Pegs ha’ gone to her grave believin’ it was my onforgiveness
laid a spell on the tothers? That’s what womenkind
be. Same as when the Faith Healers got hold of her. Arter
you was oiled and prayed over, they said ’twas want o’ faith
had killed all the tothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Was</span> I oiled and prayed over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see when you come, poor Emma felt elders and
oils was all there was left to try—there’s a rare lot of you Peculiars
down them parts and all the way to Southend, and they’d been
gettin’ round her like gulls round the plough—so the instant you
started barkin’——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barking?” gasped the little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had the croup—so she turned Peculiar,” he explained.
“Like you,” he added reproachfully. “And a wery dangerous
thing to do, bein’ as you might ha’ died like the tothers. Did,
she’d ha’ been had up for child-murder—what she accused
me of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why weren’t the doctors had up, that didn’t save all
my little brothers and sisters?” asked Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just how your mother used to argufy,” he said angrily,
flicking at poor Methusalem. “Turnin’ everything topsy-tivvy,
Oi says. And what was the result? Two years arter you was
prayed and oiled out o’ croup, she was took herself with smallpox
and wouldn’t see a soul except elders and deacons and sich-like
truck. Oi <span class='it'>will</span> say for your father though, that he was allus
firm with her; naught she could say could turn him from his
Wesleyan principles, and when he caught her smallpox he had
the doctor in like blazes and took all the medicine he could lay
hands on. But Emma would stick to her own way—though she
died of it, poor thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But didn’t you tell me father died the same day as my angel
mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t that why Oi come for you in my cart, bein’ as the
creditors sold up everythin’ except the infected beddin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, Gran’fer,” she interrupted. “But then didn’t
father die of <span class='it'>his</span> way just as much as mother of hers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a nat’ral death when you die with a doctor,” he
maintained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And were you there when they died?” said the child after
a mournful pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brow clouded obstinately. “How could Oi be, dearie,
bein’ as Oi’d taken my Bible oath?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could ha’ gone through the window?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With folks lookin’ on and nusses about, as ’ud ha’ thought
me loony. Why, ’twas impossible for me even to goo to the
funeral.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Gran’fer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked fiercer, and poor Methusalem got another flick.
“Wouldn’t Pegs be there, she havin’ her nat’ral feelin’? Could
Oi let her think Oi’d come ’cos Oi was sorry Oi hadn’t made
it up with my darter afore she died? Nay, that ’ud a-been
right-down deceit, bein’ as there wasn’t no ground for remorse.
Happen he’d a-been at the churchyard too with his fish-eye—dedn’t
you see the stone he put up, drat his imperence, as ef
Emma and Roger was aught of hisn—mebbe he’d a-preached to
me as Oi ought to ha’ forgiven my darter time she was still alive.
’Twas on the cards he’d say Oi’d broken your mother’s heart, the
blinkin’-fool, he not knowin’ ’twas me as raised her from the
dead and had her goffling lobster with your feyther in a scarlet
dressin’-gownd time he was knockin’ at her door to make
inquirations——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ve heard about that,” she interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you?” he said suspiciously. “There was only
three of us inside the door and two’s dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span> told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! Oi never told a soul—Oi’ll take my Bible oath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me just a minute ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” He was appeased. “That may be. But Oi never
told you afore—Oi’ll take my oath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, never before, Gran’fer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was afraid to stir up the subject for weeks. But her
little brain had been busy with the story, and finally taking
advantage of a not unfriendly reference to Roger Boldero, she
asked: “And was that the last time you saw father, when he
was eating lobster with my angel mother in the dead of night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay, Oi seen lots of ’em both, afore Oi was shet out
agen by molloncholy circumstances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” Jinny brightened up. “And did you always go in
by the window?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twasn’t in the house: ’twas on board the <span class='it'>Tommy Devil</span>.
And that ain’t got no doorstep.” He laughed gleefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then did you go in by the porthole?” asked Jinny, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, missie, wherever did ye get that word? Ah, Oi mind
me now—you was aboard the Watch Wessel the time we buried
poor Pegs. No, dearie, Oi just shinned up the ladder, loight as
a bird with that liddle ole oath off my showlders. But Pegs and
her one-eyed fool of a pardner never suspicioned naught, for Oi
never would set foot on the <span class='it'>Tommy Devil</span> except she was layin’
up in coves and cricks where the Gov’ment turned its glass eye—he,
he, he! Not that Oi had much stomach for his etarnal
brandy—you can’t take a satisfactory swig o’ that and keep
your sea-legs—but your feyther he kept a cask o’ beer special
for me, and Emma she ’ad allus cold roasts and kickshaws to be
washed down with it. Oi reckon Oi was on board with your
parents nigh once a month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what a pity they didn’t invite you on board years
before!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ’twas a pity. Only none of us ’ad never thought o’ that
way out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or that way in,” added Jinny excitedly. “Why, you might
have gone to my mother the day after your oath!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gaffer sighed. “Mebbe that ’ud only ha’ ruinated your
folks quicker. For Oi ain’t been on the lugger a dozen times afore
she went down and your feyther was picked up by the revenue
cutter, bein’ the onny toime he was took at sea—he, he, he!
Thussins there wasn’t no place to meet in, and to goo over Emma’s
window-sill was too risky, for Pegs and her friends was allus spyin’
around, and there wasn’t a sharper eye in the Gov’ment than
that dirty little Dap’s—when he was off duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why didn’t they come to see you at Blackwater Hall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, they couldn’t do that. That was in my oath too.
Never shall they cross <span class='it'>my</span> doorstep, neither—Oi’d sworn it on
the Book!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why didn’t they come in through <span class='it'>our</span> window? There’s
hardly ever anybody on the common?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We never thought o’ that, neither.” He heaved a deeper
sigh. “Ay, ’twas a pity,” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Jinny caught his eye resting more than once on
the vases of dried grass before their casement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a bonkka man, your feyther,” he observed at last.
“Wery big-built, and it’s a middlin’ weeny window.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Though Jinny winced at her grandfather’s attacks on the
Peculiar Faith of her angel mother, she grew in time to understand
the odd magnanimity he had evinced in letting her go to
Sunday-school with the Flynt family and pick up the doctrine.
That her one surviving child should be brought up of the sect
that had saved it, was, it transpired, poor Emma’s dying request,
as conveyed by his sister Susannah Dap to the unforgiving
father, whose oath never to cross his daughter’s doorstep still
held when he drew up Methusalem at it after the double funeral,
and found the house empty even of Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Child-stealin’, that’s what it is,’ Oi told Pegs when Oi boarded
the Watch Wessel,” he recounted once to his granddaughter in
the cart. “ ‘Ain’t you got enough o’ your own?’ says Oi. ‘’Twas
through your havin’ one too many that Jinny’s here at all,’ Oi
says. ‘Then,’ says she, sharp as a needle, ‘the more reason she’s
mine. You cut off her mother,’ says she, ‘and now, Daniel,
Jinny cuts <span class='it'>you</span> off.’ ‘Not so fast, sister,’ says Oi. ‘Whatever
my conduct to Emma—and folks with stone eyes don’t allus see
through stone walls—the poor little brat haven’t enough sense
to cut me off, and Oi don’t cut <span class='it'>her</span> off, for Oi ain’t got to wisit
sins to the fourth generation, not bein’ the Almighty, thank the
Lord. That’s my lawful property, Pegs,’ Oi says, ‘and same as
you don’t hand her over, Oi’ll summons you and carry off two o’
yourn in my cart—and what’s more Oi’ll ill-treat ’em cruel and
hide ’em twice a day with my whip.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t mean it,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dedn’t Oi, though?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they were your nephews and nieces!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more right to wallop ’em. You should ha’ seen Pegs
climb down. She know’d well as Oi never broke my word, she
bein’ o’ the same forthright family. Right up and down, Jo
Perry, as the sayin’ goos. Do to others as they’d like to do to
you—that’s good Christian gospel. Pegs she went as pale as a
white butterfly and hiked you out on deck in your little yaller
frock lookin’ as pritty as a gay. Lord, Oi reckonized you on the
nail, though Oi’d never clapped eyes on you afore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d never seen me before?” cried Jinny, amazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could Oi see you—you came arter the <span class='it'>Tommy Devil</span>
was at the bottom, and your feyther never got the dubs from the
insurance company, bein’ a flaw in the articles as swallered up
all the rest of his cash in the lawsuit. But you’d got his ways
and your mother’s looks”—Jinny flushed with pleasure—“and
’steddy cuttin’ me off, you—ha, ha, ha!—made straight for my
great ole beard and pulled out a great ole fistful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ought I to have <span class='it'>cut</span> it off?” laughed Jinny happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘D’ye see that, Pegs,’ says Oi, ‘blood’s thicker than
water. Will you come along o’ your gran’fer, liddle maid?’ says
Oi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did I say?” asked Jinny breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dedn’t say naught—you bust into tears, bein’ as you
thought Oi was the auctioneerer and you’d been sold with everything
else, poor liddle ole orphan, and then Pegs catches hold o’
you and says you was clinging to <span class='it'>her</span>. But Oi soon stopped that
lob-loll, for Oi holds you over the rail and shows you Methusalem
all prancin’ in his pride, and ‘Won’t you go with your gran’fer’s
hoss, liddle maid?’ says Oi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did I say then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dedn’t say naught, but in a twinklin’ you jumps
out o’ Susannah’s arms, scrambles down the accommodation
ladder, and was rubbin’ noses with Methusalem. And Oi
count his was as damp as yourn, bein’ as he’d come without
a stop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear old Methusalem!” And nothing would content Jinny
but she must jump down and rub noses with him now, and again
both noses were damp. But as Methusalem had seized the
opportunity to come to a standstill, and Jinny, lost in shadowy
memories, continued the caress ten seconds too long, the old
carrier declared with sudden querulousness that he hadn’t got
time for foolishness, and that since he had burdened himself
with Jinny his business had gone “to rack and ruination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peculiar, Pegs warned me, Oi’d have to bring you up,” he
added, as Jinny hastily clambered back to his side. “And
Peculiar’s the word for your gooin’s on. Not that Methusalem’s
got more sense nor you. Oi count ef there was churches for
cattle, he’d a-stoyled hisself Brother Methusalem and kicked
over his drench.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the Gaffer’s instinctive conviction that faith went with
the father. In thus yielding to Emma’s dying breath he may,
apart from the pressure of death-bed wishes, have found vent for
a lingering resentment against the seductive Boldero. Or was
it that he had a lurking apprehension that the one child of
Emma’s which had at least survived prayer, might really be a
testimony to the teaching, and as such entitled to share it? Jinny
at any rate had absolute faith in the doctrine. It rested on the
fifth chapter of James as clearly as the big Bible containing that
chapter rested on the chest of drawers. Once indeed when the
Gaffer was unbearably mocking, she had been goaded to read
him the basal verses:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the
church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in
the name of the Lord:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
raise him up: and if he have committed sins, they shall be
forgiven him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Gaffer had not collapsed as she expected. It only meant
a spiritual saving, in case he died, Daniel Quarles maintained,
unruffled: otherwise why speak of his sins being forgiven?
Moreover it didn’t say you couldn’t have a doctor, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crestfallen, the child wept in a corner and did not recover her
spirits till at Sunday-school Elder Mawhood had supplied her
for the first part of the Gaffer’s contention with Mark xvi. 18:
“They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover”;
while Martha, who was still at that date a Peculiar, comforted
and equipped her against the second part with Asa, King
of Judah, who (II Chronicles xvi) was diseased in his feet:
“<span class='it'>yet</span> sought not to the Lord but to the physicians.” The
Lord’s wishes in the matter were thus seen to be clearly indicated.
“And the Lord’s the same now as then, isn’t He?”
Martha wound up crushingly. “You ask your grandfather
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The courage to launch this counter-attack never came to her,
however, and henceforward she and her grandfather lived in that
kindly toleration of each other’s folly which comes from holding
the proofs of it, yet letting sleeping dogmas lie. What after all
was the old man’s obduracy, Jinny told herself, but part of the
perverseness and obstinacy of age? The fact that she now
never needed either doctors or elders saved her from any personal
problem. Such waverings as she had felt at fifteen were not
towards Wesleyanism, but towards Martha’s mushroom doctrine.
The texts of this convert to the latest thing in creeds were certainly
staggering, and her scorn for the still unconverted, sublime.
“We don’t take some bits o’ the Word and leave others.” That
was an argument not easy to answer, and the bits now exhumed
in support of Christadelphianism by the tireless discoverer of
King Asa were ever accumulating. Fortunately Jinny was far
too busy for religious discussions or doubts, and the “angel
mother,” softly hovering, made a restful background for the one
true Faith.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>And a sensational episode in the history of the local Brethren
came to strengthen the sect as well as to add to the number of
Jinny’s homes: came too, at the very crisis when the impossibility
of carrying the Carrier with her through the coming winter
threatened to leave her stranded alone at “The Black Sheep”
during the midday rest at Chipstone. It would have been easy
enough in summer to sit in her cart in the courtyard munching
her bread and cheese, while Methusalem was lost in his nosebag,
and clients were coming with commissions, but the parcel-shed
had no stove, and to wait in the bar or taproom or even the
parlour—all alike masculine haunts where one could hardly
dump the “scarecrow” or swain-chaser beside one—was not a
pleasant prospect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s and the Brotherhood’s good fortune began—such are
the ways of Providence—with the death of the landlord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mother Gander—so everybody called Jeff Gander’s buxom
spouse—had fought like a lioness to save him. “Not a doctor
for miles around,” as the paralysed old Bundock put it triumphantly
from his bed-of-all-news, “but she carted him over, and
set ’em all consulting and quarrelling. There was two from
London, one of ’em a bart, and all wasted. Charlie the potboy,
as he was then, feelingly told my boy, the postman, that he
could ha’ set up a public-house with the fees. Not that I approve
o’ public-houses, but leastways they give you more waluable
drinks than doctors does. And when poor Jeff was gone, and
Mother Gander was carrying on like crazy, comes the Parson and
tells her ’tis the Lord’s will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then if it’s the Lord’s will,’ says she, like lightning, for she
was always quick in the uptake, ‘why do you run down the
Peculiars as just begs the Lord to alter His will, instead o’ throwing
their hard-earned gold to the doctors?’ That was the way
her eyes opened to the Truth, and she learnt how to save her
soul as well as her money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Peculiars, they often lamented, were “not strong enough”
in Chipstone: they looked yearningly “over the water”—to
Rochford where the great Banyard himself was prophesying; or
to Woodham where no less than five hundred Brethren and Sisters
fevered themselves in a hall too small for the throngs that sought
admission. But their own meetings, though, if we may trust Caleb,
“noice things were brought out,” were numerically disheartening.
The capture of “The Black Sheep”—a hostelry to which all social
roads radiated—was thus an event of considerable importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless the dismay of the Congregationalists, of whose
community Mother Gander was a fallen pillar, was not counter-poised
in jubilation by the Brethren. For if a stronghold had
been captured, the devil had not been dispossessed. Mother
Gander doffed her gold chain, but Sister Gander gave no sign of
emptying her liquor into the gutters, and to be proud of a convert
against whose establishment you have to admonish one
another is not simple. The Peculiars managed it, however, after
some heart-searching. It was true old Bundock had been wont
to make great play with Banyard’s declaration—universally
admired as a gem of humour—“If you want to get me to a
public-house, you’ll have to take a horse and hook me.” But
after all, Elder Mawhood pointed out, “The Black Sheep” was
far more than a public-house: as the headquarters for the mail-coach
it was part of the constitution of the country, and it was
better for the farmers to eat their ordinary under a God-fearing
roof—even if they would drink with it—than for the profits of
their custom to go to a rival house which would contribute no
farthing to the Brethren’s treasury. It was Brother Flynt,
however, who supplied the finest soothing-powder. “Oi used to
condemn myself,” he said, “but ’twasn’t no good. You <span class='it'>must</span>
drink when you’re harvestin’. Don’t, you’ll be drippin’ as you
goo.” If he did not drink now that his harvesting days were
over, that did not prove other drinkers were wicked. You had
to consider circumstances. And playing the Sancho Panza still
more unexpectedly, he hinted that there was such a thing as
over-zeal. “They used to call me a Banyard as a revilin’ word,
them as made fun of us, but to tell the truth Oi’ve never got out
o’ my warm bed in the middle o’ the noight to pray as he exhorted—leastways,
not in winter. We’ve got to be thankful for Sister
Gander, and not expect her to goo all the way at the start. She
don’t want to lose her business as well as her husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it appeared that Mother Gander did not want to go
without a husband either. She suddenly, and before her year
of mourning was up, married Charley Mott, the aforesaid potboy,
not half her age, and this was a fresh upset for the Brethren,
modified only by the conversion of Charley. The Congregationalists
took the opportunity to give the couple “rough music,”
and the whole neighbourhood joined in with kettles and pokers.
Brother Bundock from his omniscient bed at first proclaimed the
scandal as a divine chastisement on his Brethren for having
failed to “admonish” her to give up purveying “beer and
’bacca”—he himself would have dared it, he declared without
fear of contradiction, had he only had his legs—but finally, when
the storm blew over, he would relate with gusto how she had
weathered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What with hating us and hating her marriage and hating the
new landlord with his jackanip’s airs, they quit her, nearly all
her customers, and them as was faithful looked askance at her
between the drinks. So she offs with her silks and on with her
apron and up with her sleeves, and back to the kitchen! She’d
been poor Jeff’s cook, you know, in the long, long ago, and ’twas
her steak and kidney puddens and her gravies and sauces that
he married, and now she was back at the old game. Whether
’twas partly to escape the sour looks that she burrowed in her
kitchen or whether the whole thing was female artfulness I don’t
pretend to say, but in two months she’d cooked ’em all back
again. Don’t come in good time, you couldn’t get a chair at
the ordinary for all the tips at Chipstone, and my boy, the
postman, he told me he hears everybody joking over the rhubarb
tart and saying as the Lord’s will is best. And she never come
out o’ that kitchen till she’d cooked it all down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was during the dark interval that Jinny and Sister Mott
<span class='it'>alias</span> Mother Gander were first drawn together, the girl being
summoned to the kitchen to receive instructions for such purchases
from local tradesmen as the lady-hermit found indispensable
yet dreaded to make in person. The fact that the little
carrier was of the despised sect cemented the relationship.
Jinny passed her midday respite in the warm kitchen, even
sharing the cook’s meal. And when at last Sister Mott resumed
her blue silk bodice and faced her tradesmen and her customers,
new and old, the run of the kitchen and the freedom of the joint
remained gratuitous to the lucky Jinny. Here under the great
bacon-hung oak beams of the ancient apartment, before a huge
fire mirroring itself rosily in the copper pans and skillets, she
could sit thawing her toes beside the clanking smokejack, while
the wind howled through the arch of the sleety courtyard.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> coach from railhead to Chipstone was an hour and a half
late, and not all the flourish of its horn as it thundered into the
courtyard of “The Black Sheep” could disguise the fact. Not
that it was the fault of the coach: it had waited for the mail
train, and this, for those parts, parvenu monster had found an
obstruction on the line, and was helpless to go round it, as the
driver and the guard complacently pointed out. Their glory
and their tips were shrunk like their circuit—unchanged along
the short route, they could no longer prod the slumbering
traveller with insinuatory farewells: they knew themselves,
these Chipstone worthies, a last lingering out-of-the-way survival
of the old order, doomed like the broad coaching road and the
old hostelries to decay; already they had seen the horned guard
decline in places to the omnibus cad, even as the ancient
“shooter” of highwaymen had sunk to the key-bugler; yet
they preserved the grand manner before the revolution that was
deposing them—the Tom Pratt and Dick Burrage of a generation
of travellers—and while dispensing their conversation like
decorations and drinking your health as a concession, they
retailed with gloomy satisfaction every railway collision and
holocaust, as though coaches never overturned, and declared the
English breed of horses would be ruined. And when certain lines
set up third-class carriages they denounced the cruelty of packing
the poor in roofless, seatless trucks, as though they themselves
had never brought into port frost-bitten peers or dames sodden
through their oilskin umbrellas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to-day “Powerful warrum” was the grumble of the
passengers, even of those on the roof, the majority being—thus
early in May—still smothered in box-coats; as for the unfortunates
compressed inside, who had likewise not yet cast a clout,
and had similarly mistrusted the sunshiny spell with which that
pouring April had ended, they mopped their brows and cursed
the fickle British climate. But though the sun had suddenly
become hot enough to sour milk, it could not sour the temper of
the bronzed young man—his face nigh as ruddy as his hair—who
sat on the box-seat and conversed with Tom Pratt almost
as an equal. Even the long delay on the line had left him
unruffled, thanks largely to the blue-eyed girl in the train who
before his clean-shaven cosmopolitan air had shown signs of
tenderness, and whose address his purse now held—more precious
than a fiver. Verily a pleasant change after the Eveless back-blocks
of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the idea of calling this “warrum”! He smiled to think
of the hells he had known—Montreal with mosquitoes, New York
in a damp heat. Why, this couldn’t even melt a man’s collar.
And how refreshing was the trimness of the Essex countryside—the
comfortable air of immemorial cultivation—after the giant
untidiness of the New World. How soothing these long, green,
white-sprinkled hedgerows with their ancient elms, this old,
historic highway with thatch and tile, steeple and tower, after
the corduroy roads of round logs or the muddy, dusty, sandy
tracks. How adorable these creeper-covered cottages after log-cabins
in backwoods; rotting floors on rotten sleepers and the
mud paste fallen out of the walls. He forgot that it was precisely
this that he had fled from nearly a decade ago—this dead,
walled-in life, so petty and pietistic—and he congratulated
himself afresh on the wisdom of that abrupt resolution to sell his
clearing to a second-hand pioneer and to farm at home with the
profits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His clothes alone would have kept him in good humour. Not
only were the heavier in what he had learned to call his trunk,
but those on his back were the first he had ever had made to
measure. And they were made too—like the neckcloth and
shawl and fal-lals he was bringing to his parents “from America”—by
the world-famous firm of “Moses &amp; Son” (opposite Aldgate
Church), whose imposingness was enhanced in his eyes by
finding it—on the Saturday he first hied thither—haughtily
aloof: a blank wilderness of shutters in a roaring world, with
no gleam through their chinks from the seven hundred gas-burners.
But he had finally stormed the “Private Hall,”
toiling—as invited by rhyme—up “the stairs of solid oak,” and
had gained the heights “where orders were bespoke,” and there—in
that rich-carpeted “showroom with the giant chandelier,”
in a setting of Corinthian columns, sculptured panels, and
arabesque ceilings—dark enchanters with tape-measures like
serpents over their shoulders had made obeisance to him and
enfolded him with their coils. Even his billycock hat verified
the bardic boast:</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Left to himself he would have liked a wideawake, but that
<span class='it'>arbiter elegantiarum</span>, the small boy, he was warned, had not quite
acquiesced in that. If it was not a coat of many buttons that
he now sported, it was scrimp enough to show off the fine lines
of his figure; for the movement towards ample waistcoats and
wide trousers was not yet encouraged by his Aldgate mentors,
and pockets on the hips had been conceded him with reluctance.
In his large American trunk reposed a still grander suit of Sunday
sable, though he had shied at a frock coat, and was glad to learn
from these hierophants of the mode that morning jackets were
no longer confined to the stable-yard or the barrack-room, but
were permissible even in the country house—and there was no
question but Frog Farm was that. He had already worn his
blacks once, on his visit to the Great Exhibition, and they made,
he found, a distinct difference to the policemen in top-hats
whose guidance he sought in the labyrinths of the metropolis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The delay in this visit to the Exhibition—the goal of his
journey to London—had turned out an advantage, he felt, giving
him time for these measured elegancies. If he had been
unable to be in at the opening, as he had grandly designed in
Canada when ignorant that this involved guineas and season-tickets,
he had managed to squeeze for a glimpse of the Queen
outside if not inside the Park, and the first five-shilling day—after
all, only the fourth—was grandeur enough for a whilom
ploughboy and cabin-boy. Although nine ten-pound notes made
a warm waistcoat-lining, he was not under the illusion that he
had returned with more than a competence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One would have thought London itself a Greater Exhibition
to a young man who had never seen it before: especially London
at carnival with its colossal crowds swollen by visitors from all
countries in all complexions and costumes: London with its
numberless gay ’buses (plying mostly to Hyde Park), its swifter
gliding cabriolets of the new pattern invented by Mr. Hansom,
and the more stolid procession of four-wheeled clarences, not to
mention the fashionable and civic carriages with the scarlet-and-gold
pomp of flunkeys and outriders: London with its countless
curious street-criers, costermongers, ballad-mongers, watercress
sellers, muffin and hot-pie men, birdcage dealers, tract-peddling
Lascars in white robes, and vendors of everything from corn-salves
to speeches on the scaffold; blowsy, rowdy London that
turned into a dream-city when those strange figures with rods
glided through the twilight, flecking the long, grey streets with
points of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though Will Flynt was not insensitive to these fascinating
phenomena, and even rode about recklessly in the cabriolets at
eightpence a mile, yet London had not the spell to hold him.
Only the Great Exhibition had drawn him across the Atlantic.
While awaiting impatiently for the five-shilling day, he duly did
the Tower and the Zoo (sixpence extra for Mr. Gould’s humming-birds
in the twenty-five glass cases), paid twopence to go into
St. Paul’s, and a shilling to see the Great Globe in Leicester
Square, patronized Phelps at Sadler’s Wells, and the horses at
Astley’s, had a peep at Vauxhall, enjoyed “Rush, the Norwich
Murderer,” at Madame Tussaud’s, and submitted the boots these
operations begrimed to the red-coated shoeblacks of the Ragged
Schools—London’s new word in philanthropy. But though he
liked the quarter in which his quaint galleried hotel, “The
Flower Pot,” was situated, with the Spitalfields Market and the
tall old houses of the silk-weavers, whose vast casements with
their little panes rose story on story, he was no sooner through
with the visit to the Exhibition than without a day’s delay—as
promised in that letter to Martha—he took train and coach to
Little Bradmarsh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beholding him thus on the County Flyer hurrying towards
Frog Farm, after only a single visit to the stupendous spectacle,
one may suspect that he did not know his own heart as well as
he imagined. But he himself had no doubt of the magnet he
obeyed, and he had found on his boat not a few rich Canadians—and
the Dominion already boasted four thousand carriage-folk—who
confessed to have yielded to the same irresistible attraction.
There was indeed little else talked of on the voyage: even the
wonders of the boat itself—a new Yankee iron and screw steamer
of nearly two thousand tons and quite five hundred horse-power
that brought them to Liverpool in eleven days from Halifax,
and had spittoons and wedding-berths like the Yankee river-steamers,
and to see which the Liverpudlians had flocked with
their sixpences—paling before the world-marvel awaiting them
in London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And London itself was talking of it no less: for once London
was staggered. And if London was thus shaken, how much
more the provinces and the world at large? Did not indeed the
flags of all nations wave over the great glass building, whose
mere material would have been enough to set the globe agog,
even if it had not contained contributions from every corner of
civilization except Germany, which in that antediluvian age
figured in the catalogue only as “The States of the Zollverein.”
What wonder if with all the excursions and alarums and millennial
visions that attended its birth, the Press reeking with
paragraphs, poems, discussions, wrangles, skits, prophecies, and
forebodings, crowds equal to the population of provincial towns
gathered at the Park to watch it rise, and to stare at the endlessly
inrolling vans and the sappers and miners at work in
their uniforms. One M.P.—military and moustachio’d—won the
immortality of the comic prints by fulminating against the
invasion of Freethinking foreigners who would pillage London
and ruin the honour of British womanhood: more sober minds
feared the Chartist mobs and the Red Republicans: even the
Catholics, already flaunting their cardinals and ringing their
unhallowed church bells, would profit by the Continental wave.
The House of Lords resounded with protests and petitions
against the profanation of the Park, and apprehensions as to the
fate of the building erected therein were equally rife: the great
glass roof would be splintered by hailstones, the walls would be
overturned by the wind, the galleries would collapse under the
swarming multitudes, and Anarchism would seize its opportunity
amid the dismantled treasures of the globe. But one unfailing
factor was on the Exhibition’s side: the scheme was attacked
by the <span class='it'>Times</span>. And so Paxton’s building rose steadily till the
great day when through an avenue of three-quarters of a million
spectators the Queen and “that Queen’s indefatigable husband”—as
a panegyrist of the period put it—drove to declare it open
to the elect thirty thousand who had already found it so, while
through glittering nave and transept, with their fountains, trees,
flowers, and statues, the “Hallelujah Chorus” thundered from
a thousand voices, two hundred orchestral instruments, and a
dozen giant organs; and the millennial hope welled up in a
grand climax of universal emotion. And hoary grandsires
should hereafter tell—proclaimed the poet of the Great Catalogue—what
in this famous century befell: grey Time should chronicle
the victories gained, since Mercy o’er the world and Justice
reigned:</p>

<p class='pindent'>But although our Canadian pioneer had thus ample excuse for
the unrest that forbade him to miss this Messianic spectacle, it
was not—even he would have admitted—the Great Exhibition
which had first unsettled his stolid labours. That oscillation
had been communicated some two years earlier, and by a shock
that had set the New World rattling even more noisily than the
Old was shaken by the Great Exhibition. The discovery of gold
in California was a seismic vibration that depopulated Eastern
towns, shot sober lawyers into wagons, sent clergymen flying
along mule-trails, swept timid tradesmen across the foodless and
robber-haunted Rocky Mountains, whirled schoolmasters fifteen
thousand miles round Cape Horn, and dumped them all waist-high
in auriferous mud and shimmering water, to be fed by
Indian squaws. It was under the lure of the Californian legend
that Will had originally looked about for a purchaser of his
cleared acres. But by the time the farm was off his hands, the
glamour of easy gold had faded, and with a sum in his pockets
sufficient for a little respite, life seemed suddenly larger than
lucre, and he found himself possessed by a strange craving not
to be away from the old country in that year of years—the year
of the Great Exhibition.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Chipstone had seemed strangely shrivelled as the County
Flyer tore through it; the High Street unexpectedly narrow
and the great, gorgeous shops, against whose panes he had
flattened his youthful nose, curiously small and drab, with
diminutive sun-blinds; yet the quaint, blistered bulge of the old
timbered houses was fascinatingly as he remembered it, and
when the spirited quartet of tinkling steeds slackened under the
archway crowned by the ironwork sign of “The Black Sheep,”
he saw through a warm dimness that the ancient inn still gave
on the stable-yard with this same Tudor bulge, and that the
courtyard itself was little less rambling than the picture he
carried in his memory. There was the same mass-meeting of
cocks crowing on the same golden dunghill, the same litter of
barrels, boxes, baskets, and parcels of laundry-work, while the
gardens of the whitewashed old cottages backing the black-tarred
stables and cartsheds seemed caught up as incongruously
as ever in the horsey medley. Why, there was the very shed
which had sheltered the farm-wagon the Sunday he was to drive
it to Harwich. And there—yes, actually there on the same
doorstep, under the same hanging ironwork lamp, was Ostler
Joe, the shambling, bottle-nosed hunchback, whose figure—in its
reassurance of stability—struck him as positively beautiful, and
whose head seemed aureoled by the mist. But where was that
more expected face, where was the hair-swathed visage of Caleb
Flynt? Brushing the mist from his eyes, he looked anxiously
round the seething, sun-drenched courtyard. “Hullo, Joey,” he
said at last. “Wouldn’t my dad wait?” It was a pleasant
voice with something of a twang: but the twang was no longer
local.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi dunno your feyther from Adam,” said Joe cheerfully,
mopping his face with his shirt-sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you do—old Mr. Flynt—Frog Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joe shook his head—it seemed no longer a saint’s. “Oi never
heerd nobody mention Frog Farm nowadays. It’s a dead place.”
He shambled off on his many tasks with an aliveness that
tightened the contraction Will felt at his heart. His father dead?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look here, Joe!” He pursued the factotum. “You
remember me—little Will Flynt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say as Oi does—moind that box now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s <span class='it'>my</span> box—and I wrote to dad to meet me with a trap.
Guess he got tired of fooling around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s warious traps.” The hunchback waved a busy
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—he’s not here. And how am I to get my trunk home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bradmarsh carrier goos at three—you’re in luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heaved a parcel now into a driverless tilt-cart, where a
little white dog boisterously mounted guard. “That’s ’er!” he
said. “Take you too if you’re smart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daniel Quarles!” A fresh wave of reassurance radiated
from that old household word on the familiar tilt. So the
venerable carrier was still plying, how then could the comparatively
juvenile Caleb be extinct? The May Day ribbons not
removed from Daniel’s horse, and making it a snow-white steed
from fairyland, dispelled the last funereal images. Surely had
Caleb Flynt really died, old Quarles would never have left so
lively a topic untapped with Joey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here Will’s meditations were agreeably cut short by
another vision from auld lang syne—the laced mob-cap and
blonde kiss-curls of Mother Gander, to whom Dick Burrage was
gloating over the train’s misadventure. There were pouches
under the blue eyes, and no gold chain now heaved with her blue
silk bosom: otherwise she was her old comely self. But fresh
from his grand hotel in Spital Square, Will no longer regarded her
as an awful and aristocratic personage, able to eat meat at every
meal. An easy accost and inquiry about the old Flynts of Frog
Farm brought him soothing information. Lord bless his soul,
people living a healthy life like that never died—unless they took
medicine. She couldn’t say they had been to chapel lately—indeed
she had gathered from the postman that the old wife had
taken up with some New Jerusalem crankiness. “But you’ll
find the Bradmarsh carrier in the parcel-shed—that black one.
You ask <span class='it'>her</span>!” And with a wave towards the arch she turned
again to the beaming Dick Burrage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will thought the “her” referred to a chambermaid who was
just passing, but he saw no need of such guidance—the parcel-shed
was obvious enough. His mind was occupied with the odd
fact that Mother Gander had apparently become a sister in the
spirit to his own father, while his mother had moved on to another
eccentric doctrine. Ah well, changes were bound to come. Not
everybody could be of the same immutable granite as himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found the parcel-shed deserted save for a young girl who,
busily heaping up parcels into the willing arms of Joey, did not
even look up. Somewhat depressed by the chapel-memories the
landlady had conjured up, he stood a moment, absently watching
the operation, and wondering why the agreeably pretty creature
should be dispatching so many parcels—wedding-cake came into
his mind, though the oddly varying shape of the parcels was not
consistent with the hypothesis. He would willingly have loitered—the
chapel-cloud was dissipating—but the carrier was clearly
not here, and, as the church clock opposite was booming three, he
was afraid old Daniel might be starting off without him, so he
hurried back to the pranked and pawing steed, only to find
himself derided and defied by the little dog, which he now
observed was also adorned with a May Day bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he remembered he was hungry. The block on the
line had robbed him of his dinner, and he wondered whether to
go off with that grim Gaffer Quarles would be so enjoyable as
walking—after a square meal. No, why should he be thus
whisked off? Why not a leisurely spread at “The Black
Sheep” preceded by another glimpse of the girl in the shed, and
then a long stroll home by the dear old field-paths, through
Plashy Walk and Swash End, dry enough doubtless under this
sun? Besides, his slow old parent might be on the way after
all—there was no certainty the carrier with his compulsory
windings and detours would not miss him. Yes, it would be
kinder to his father to give him another hour or so. “The May
Queen” he murmured to the air, brooding over Methusalem’s
belated ribbons. Yes, they would surely have made her that;
though perhaps the old custom was no longer kept up. True,
she hadn’t the blue eyes or the plumpness of the girl in the train,
and was not stately enough for a queen—though of course you
couldn’t really tell how Victoria looked outside her royal carriage.
But then you couldn’t imagine the blue-eyed minx in a royal
carriage at all: you placed her smiling behind bars, manipulating
beer-handles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” Joey startled him by announcing, toppling
his tower of parcels into the cart. “Oi’ve made inquirations.
The old Flynt chap be aloive and kickin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you.” Will’s last shade of uneasiness vanished. He
slipped a sixpence into Joey’s palm. “Put my box in—I’m not
going myself—say it’s for Frog Farm.” And he jostled back to
the parcel-shed, through the bustle of boxes and jangling of bells,
barging into other carriers from other circuits, stumbling over
dogs that yelped, tangling himself in the whip of a postboy who
was frantically buttoning his waistcoat, and nearly run over by
the great coach just wheeling round. He was more disappointed
than surprised when he at last reached the shed to find it empty,
though far fuller than before of mere people. Still, there was
always dinner.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But dinner was not always.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m afraid it’s all gone,” said Mother Gander. She was
blocking the way at the foot of the stairs, where a painted hand
under pendent stag-horns directed you upwards to the “Parlour”—“The
Black Sheep” would have none of your new-fangled
“Coffee Rooms”—and Will Flynt, sniffing up the odours of
beer, sand, tobacco, gin, snuff, and tallow like an ambrosial air,
felt a further elation in the thought of its being now a beckoning
not a monitory hand: to ascend to those unexplored heights,
mysteriously grand to the boy, seemed symbolic of his rise in
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But haven’t you got <span class='it'>any</span>thing?” His face fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing fit to offer,” said the landlady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m hungry—and I’ve got to wait here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not staying for the night?” she queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may,” he said, to encourage her to produce some food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but we haven’t a room empty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reddened. Was it possible she recognized the hobnailed
lad of yore, refused to serve him or to allow him up her aristocratic
stairs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t a room empty?” he repeated incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a poky garret,” she said, “and another man would
have to go through it to his bedroom, and he goes to bed very
late and gets up very early. But even our best rooms are stuffy
and our corridors are that dingy people are always tumbling
against the brooms the maids leave about; when they’re not
tumbling down the stairs. Look how steep they are! The
whole house is badly built—it was never meant for an hotel—and
the service is disgraceful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will, overwhelmed, stammered out deprecation of her abuse.
The inn was most picturesque, he urged, and it was not the fault
of the house if the coach was late; as for himself a crust of bread
and cheese would suffice to stay his pangs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, go up and see what you can get,” she rejoined sceptically,
moving aside. Relieved to find the barrier raised, he
ascended the dog-legged staircase; his boyish awe resurging.
Alas! even the landlady’s disparagement had not prepared him
for this dishevelled scene—dirty plates and greasy knives and
forks and tobacco-stoppers and sloppy pewter pots that had
stamped bleary rims on the fly-haunted table-cloth, and a waiter
in his shirt-sleeves dining, like a gentleman, off the ruins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wegetables and pastry is hoff!” murmured this disturbed
gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was retreating—bread and cheese at the bar amid the
glinting bottles and shining beer-handles seemed more appetizing—but
the waiter had sprung up, his mouth still masticating but
his coat conjured on, and had him fixed instanter on a Windsor
chair at a clean little sun-splashed table by a side window that
was refreshingly open and gave on the cheery courtyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cut of the devastated joint, strong mustard pickles, a hunch
of good bread, a pint of porter and the freedom of the cheese to
follow, soon dispelled the dismalness of the room; an effect to
which the attendant magician contributed more literally by his
great trick of vanishing crumbs and disappearing plates, including
his own half-eaten meal. How good it was, this cold roast beef
of old England, how equally redolent of the dear old country
those hunting pictures on the low wainscoted walls, with all
their gay bravado. There were four of them: <span class='it'>The Meet</span>,
<span class='it'>Breaking Cover</span>, <span class='it'>Full Cry</span>, <span class='it'>The Death</span>; all populous with spirited
pink gentlemen and violently animated dogs and horses, culminating
in the leading dog tearing the fox, and the leading gentleman
waving his tall hat in rapture. He quaffed voluptuously at his
frothing pewter pot. To the Queen of the May—ay, why not
drink to <span class='it'>her</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s Mr. Gander?” he asked irrelevantly, with a sudden
image of the bull-necked landlord and his massive gold scarfpin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter—on the point of disappearing—materialized himself
again, and stared at the questioner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ain’t <span class='it'>any</span>how,” he gasped at last. “At least that’s a
secret ’twixt him and his Maker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead?” It was Will’s turn to gasp. Could so much gross
vitality be extinct, or even rarefied?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead and married over. She’s Mrs. Mott now, though the
old customers will keep on with the Mother Gander, just as I
have to bite my tongue not to call her husband Charley.” He
lowered his voice. “He was the potboy once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will whistled. “What women are!” was in that knowing
note. How pleasant it was thus to discuss—with beer and
pickles!—life and death and the sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir—the potboy, and busting with pride if I let him
hand up the plates at the Bowling Club dinner.” A sigh accented
the cruel change. “You’ve been away, sir, I presoom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half round the world,” said Will with airy inaccuracy. “But
why didn’t <span class='it'>you</span> go in for her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! With my old woman! Besides <span class='it'>I</span> wasn’t going to
turn Peculiar—no, not for ten ‘Black Sheep.’ You’ve heard o’
Peculiars, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye-es.” A cayenne pod in the pickles made him cough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thick as blackberries about these parts—and as full of texts
as the bush of prickles.” The waiter’s voice sank again. “She
made poor Charley into one of ’em. He’s got to go to chapel
three times every Sunday and once on Wednesday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor chap!” There was sympathy as well as mockery in
Will’s tone. “But can you tell me”—he had a sudden remembrance—“why
she runs down this place so? Is it her Peculiar
conscience?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I’ve heard others arx that too. My opinion ain’t
worth a woman’s tip, but I can’t help fancying it’s more defiance
than conscience. Time was, you see, sir, folks kept away, and
it sort o’ soured her. I don’t want your rotten custom, she as
good as says to all and sundry. Take it to landladies who’ve
arxed your permission to marry. And so they come all the
more, sir, yes, and cringing to have rooms, and pays her whatever
she asks. There was lots o’ grumbling in the old days: now
you never hear a complaint, except from herself. My stars, the
money she’s making! But I can’t say I envy Charley—not even
when he bullies me. Although in marriage if it’s not one cross
it’s another, ain’t it, sir? Or perhaps you’re one o’ the lucky
ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not married at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I mean.” And the waiter sighed again. “Got
all you want, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything, thank you—not wanting a wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His laugh, gurgling away into his pewter pot, evoked only a
deeper sigh, on which the waiter seemed wafted without.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Simultaneously—through the opening or closing door—something
was wafted within. Our complacent young man at his
place in the sun, with the glow of freedom at his heart and of
porter at his throat, was startled by something leaping on his
knees, which, automatically fended and thrust away, was felt as
clinging claws scraping down his new trousers. Coughing and
spluttering, and with the beery glow changing to a choke, he
perceived that it was the carrier’s little white dog, the very same
that had warned him off its master’s goods; unmistakable by
its pink bow. So the doddering patriarch had not yet started,
he thought lazily, though he must now be back in his cart or his
canine sentry would not have gone off for a farewell prowl. He
helped himself to another cut of beef, and his thoughts wandered
from Mother Gander to a builder’s widow he had known in a
Montreal boarding-house, a widow to whom he could certainly
have played the Charley had he cared to go so far. He seemed
to hear her foolish whimpering the day he left for the backwoods,
but he became aware that it was only the carrier’s dog whining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was begging so prettily on its hind legs, looking so appealing
in its pink bow, that he was soon feeding it rather than himself,
and morsel after morsel fell to it, each gulped down with such
celerity that from the creature’s instantly renewed and unchangingly
pathetic posture of supplication, an absent-minded man
would have doubted if he had fed the brute at all. But finally
the young man pushed away his cheese-plate, and dropping with
plenary satisfaction upon a horsehair and mahogany arm-chair
that stood by the empty grate, he lit his cherrywood pipe with a
brimstone match and followed his springtide fancies in clouds of
his own making. Thus the second pounce of the dog on to his
knees found him acquiescent, even caressing, and with a beatific
grunt the animal curled itself up as to an æon of repose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a horn sounded, and with a convulsive start the creature
was off his lap and scratching and yapping at the closed door.
Will, too, had a moment of wild wishing he had engaged a seat
in the cart—the thought of walking in this heat was no longer
alluring—but it was equally unimaginable to get up now and
rush like the animal. Besides, he hadn’t paid his bill, he remembered
not discontentedly. Meanwhile the distracted little dog
had darted back to the window and leapt on the sill, but it was
obviously cowering before the depth of the jump. He was
feeling he really must get up and do its will, when to the satisfaction
of the slothful man and the bliss of the active beast, the
door opened, and like a streak of lightning the white figure had
forked across the room and vanished. He turned his head
lazily to the window to see if it would catch its cart, but was
only in time to see the tail-board with his own box disappearing
through the archway, pursued by Joe with a belated bundle.
Then the new-comers claimed his languorous attention.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Strictly speaking, there was only one new-comer and he was
hanging back at the sight of the London-tailored guest, being
himself in moleskins and bent and fusty, though Mother Gander
was clearly beckoning him forward. “The gentleman’s just
going,” she said sweetly. Will knew not whether to be drowsily
pleased at the status he had achieved in his own neighbourhood,
or sluggishly wrathful at this renewed attempt to be rid
of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty left,” he observed encouragingly, puffing immovably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi reckon, sister, Oi’ll feed in the taproom.” The voice sent
strange vibrations of resentment through Will’s being, and
particularly through his nostrils, where a mysterious smell of
aniseed was called up, whether from memory or the actual
moleskins he could not make out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll do no such thing,” said Mother Gander sharply. “It’s
less trouble here. Remember what James says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who was James—was her husband not Charley?—Will was
wondering dreamily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chapter two, warse two—Oi take your p’int,” answered this
odd figure, whose wizened face with the straggling whiskers
seemed loathsomely familiar. But though the beady eyes under
the moleskin cap were turned for a moment full on his, remembrance
stirred but feebly through his after-dinner lethargy, and
it was not till the intruder had sinuously and softly skirted the
great dining-table and begun solemnly turning the faces of the
hunting pictures to the wall, like naughty schoolchildren, that
he was dully conscious of the secret of his abhorrence. There—on
the very first day of his return—was Joshua Mawhood, the
button-snipping villain of his story!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mother Gander stood by silent, as one properly censured.
Neither did she protest when, slashing a giant gobbet off the beef,
he carried it on the point of the carving-knife to Will’s mustard-strewn
meat-plate, and bearing the same with its dirty knife
and fork to the remotest corner of the table, fell to with audible
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send you your milk, Deacon,” she said, turning to leave
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t copy Jael too far,” he answered, with a grimace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Copy who?” asked Mother Gander, mystified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite—her as killed Sisera.
Like me he asked for water, and, like you, she gave him milk.
But she meant to nail him like a stoat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me murder you!” said Mother Gander with a scandalized
air. But she was clearly impressed by his erudition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis onny my fun. But you look up Judges, chapter fower.
They’re beacons to us—they old Hebrews and Hebrewesses—beacons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you rather not have the milk?” Mother Gander
was still a little puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tain’t for me to refuse a sister’s kindness. And the best
way to repay her is to take it with rum. Bein’ as there’s a
wisitor, the leetlest drop o’ rum in it, to show Oi don’t howd
with your rebukers in that regard. Send the bottle separate, to
be plain to all beholders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And send me another pint of porter, please,” added Will.
He felt he must justify his stay even as the Deacon must justify
his drink. The ecclesiastical preferment that had come to Elder
Mawhood amused him—his boyish resentment faded suddenly,
and the respectable rat-catcher—after all, the motor-impulse of
his fortunes—now loomed through a cloud of kindly indulgence;
even touched with the glamour of early memories, with the
magic of those far-off winters whose approach had brought the
expert to Frog Farm, as surely as it brought in from the hedges
the creatures against whom he waged cunning battle in the war-zone
of the barns and outbuildings. How thrilled the boy had
been by the great traps and the pack of ferrets—nay, had not
the strange old man seemed himself a larger ferret, with his
tight-fitting moleskins, sidling motions, and curiously small
shining eyes? What a joy his annual visit—with what fearful
interest the bunch of children had listened to the annual contract,
made for gross sums, or for particular buildings, sometimes
calculated per tail of rats! The Elder had always made a point
of the cost of the shoe-leather involved in the isolation of Frog
Farm. Aniseed, Will suddenly remembered, had played a considerable
part in beguiling the victims, and the scent of it, coming
up again,—dream-whiff or reality—was now incongruously
mingled with a flavour of youth and innocence, touching our
rustic Ulysses almost to tears. He wheeled his arm-chair
window-wards to hide his emotion, and puffed into the courtyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi don’t object to your smokin’,” mumbled the Deacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Will. “You don’t remember me, I’m
afraid, Mr. Mawhood.” “Deacon” he could not bring his
tongue to. “I’m Will Flynt, the looker’s boy you were
always so kind to. You let me set your traps and dose the
bait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Deacon shot a beady look at him, but shook his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you let me smell your ferret once, don’t you remember,
when it came out of the hole by the Brad, and you said that
though I hadn’t heard a squeak or a scamper, your nose could
tell there had been rats in the run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was swarms of boys at Frog Farm, all bad ’uns. Oi
never knew ’em by tail—but Oi dessay Oi do remember ye in
the rough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was strangely disappointed. “Don’t you remember I
lent you my slate to hide the trap from that cute old
rascal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, warmints allus runs to cover,” said the Deacon
vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when caught he wouldn’t eat the bait, surely you
remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They never does. Rats has more sperrit than lions,” said
the Deacon with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The abortive attempt to recall himself to the rat-catcher was
ended by the return of the waiter, whose delicate balance of rum-bottle,
milk-glass, and pewter pot on the tiniest of trays, was
almost upset by the sight of the blank backs of the hunting
pictures. He seemed as startled as though he was not in the
conjuring line himself. Depositing the drinks, with his usual
sleight of hand, at both ends of the room simultaneously, he
made as if to reverse the pictures. But the Deacon emitted a
sibilance so terrifying that he did the vanishing trick instead.
The old man then produced from either pocket a pale-yellow,
pink-eyed creature, and emptied the milk-glass into a saucer.
“How thirsty they gets this weather,” he observed, as they
lapped greedily at the milk. “Pore things—their need is
greater than mine.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Will was sipping his porter <span class='it'>piano</span>, and the Deacon his rum
<span class='it'>strepitoso</span>—the ferrets back in his pockets—when the door
opened afresh, and a new figure protruded through it, likewise
drawing back when the room which should have been empty
at that hour was seen to be in occupation. This was, however,
a very different figure from the Deacon’s: a figure
jovial and ponderous, sporting a floral dressing-gown and carpet
slippers, and with all the air of having just left an adjacent
bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in—don’t mind me,” called Will cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smoker’s invitation not being negatived by the muncher
and bibber, the massive visitor padded forwards, revealing more
clearly his heavy-jowled hairless rubicund face and the motley
multitude of stains on his gay dressing-gown, and waving a roll
of clammy-smelling posters. “Just come by the coach—and in
the nick o’ time,” he observed genially. And espying in the
reversed pictures a favourable background for his operations, he
circumvented the table (not without surprise and disgust at the
corner where the moleskinned man grunted, guzzled, and guttled),
and hung up two of the bills on the nails without any observable
astonishment at the state of the pictures or any apparent attention
to anything but his own interests; stepping backwards to
survey the effect with such absorption of mind that through the
girdle of his dressing-gown his spine collided with the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my boy!” he addressed Will. “They can’t print like
that in Chipstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From his arm-chair Will could easily read the more glaring
headlines:</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds bully,” he observed politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bully’s the word, my young American friend,” said the
Showman. “What a pity the mail-coach was late—we might
have had ’em stuck up for the ordinary and caught some shilling
patrons. You’re staying here for the night, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—I’ve got to go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity! I was about to offer you a front seat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must fill up somehow,” said the Showman frankly. “People
never go to a play unless they think they can’t get in. And as
we only open to-night, there’s not been time to advertise our
bumper houses. You see, sonny, we lay up here for the winter,
and if we’d started before this heat-wave we’d have caught
more colds than coppers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it open-air then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but the next thing to it—a tent! By squinting out of
that window you’ll see the whole caboodle rising on the meadows
like a giant mushroom. Why not stop here and pick up a young
lady? I’ll give you <span class='it'>two</span> seats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t want more than one seat when I’ve got a girl,” laughed
Will. Then the face of the girl in the parcel-shed came up, at
once alluring and rebuking, and he repeated that seriously he
must be off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind—better luck next act,” said the Showman, and
tugged furiously at the bell-pull, and the waiter appeared with
a glass of brandy and water, as though he added thought-reading
to his conjuring accomplishments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here’s to our better——!” began the Showman. His
eye, raised towards Will at the window, caught suddenly something
in the courtyard, and setting down his untasted glass and
snatching up his posters he disappeared almost as frantically as
the dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s forgot he ain’t dressed,” chuckled the waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to be a merry gent,” said Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lives here all the while the show is on,” said the waiter, not
without pride. “Pays me a shilling every time I go in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope on the same principle Mother Gander will pay <span class='it'>me</span>,”
said Will, laughing, and ordered his bill: which he found as
unreasonable as the food was excellent. He did not, however,
mulct the waiter of the handsome tip, designed to show him
not a woman but a man and a gentleman at that, and
the waiter finally disappeared with congees instead of with
conjurings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you will excuse me, old fellow,” said the Showman,
re-entering, “but business before pleasure. Fact is, I got up
too late to catch the carriers, but now I’ve got the postman to
leave my bills at all the public-houses on his next round. Good
fellow, Bundock, though why he should boast so over killing
two frogs with one stone, I don’t understand. It seems an
operation as cruel as it is simple.” Here he swigged at his
neglected glass. “He made a point, too, of my not employing
the Bellman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have done better with the Bellman here in Chipstone
and over at Latchem,” volunteered Will. “Where Bundock
mostly goes, you’ll never get ’em to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Bundock said. But don’t you believe it,
sonny.” He held up a huge hairy forefinger, half gilded with a
great ring. “They’re only a canting lot o’ sons of slow-coaches.
They’ve never had the chance of knowing what they like.
Temptation’s the thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The diaconal sibilance that greeted this sinister sentiment fell
unheeded on the Showman’s ear, or rather he did not distinguish
it from the worthy Mawhood’s general medley of guttural and
nasal noises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no greater temptation,” added the Showman, “than
Shakespeare and the Ballet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will shook his head. “They don’t know one from t’other.
Did—I mean, if they did”—he had slipped into the old idiom—“they’d
be scandalized. Why, I went to see a piece of Shakespeare
at Sadler’s Wells myself last week, and I’m bound to say
’twas a bit thick—though splendidly acted, mind you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t tell me that. Phelps!” He smacked his fleshy
lips voluptuously. “Lord! What a job that man had to clear
out the beer-sellers, babies, and filthy-mouthed roughs, and now
it’s the quietest show in London. What was the piece?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t remember the name—about a nigger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Othello?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it—sounded a rather Irish name for a nigger I
thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Irish? Ah, yes—ha, ha, ha! You had me there! By
Jove, that’s a new wheeze!” And he roared genially, while the
innocent, and it is to be feared sadly illiterate, Will tried to look
like a successful humorist. “Anyhow,” he said, “you won’t
get ’em from Little Bradmarsh, no, nor Long Bradmarsh either.
They think all actors are wicked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so they be!” burst forth the Deacon at last. “Hobs
and jills ought to be kept apart!” He stuck his knife towards
the poster. “<span class='it'>The High Road to Marriage</span>, indeed! High road
to Hell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear, hear,” agreed the Showman surprisingly, rattling his
glass. “Well put, old cock. But these ain’t actors; only
puppets. You can’t be wicked in wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I must be off,” said Will, rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then here’s luck to you.” He finished his glass. “And
may you die before you’re buried!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, I hope I shan’t do either, Mr. Duke.” He took his
hat and stick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not Duke, old man. Flippance, Anthony Flippance, universally
docked to Tony Flip. Duke only goes with the Marionettes.
I bought ’em lock, stock, and barrel—-the oldest circuit in East
Anglia, and the name going well with the crowned heads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there are no crowned heads in America,” said Will,
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, sonny,” contradicted Mr. Flippance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve just come from there,” said Will crushingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how about the Emperor of Brazil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Will blankly. He seemed really to have heard
of this personage. Then recovering, he said: “But have you
played before him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not my affair,” said Mr. Flippance. “It ain’t my
responsibility what Duke’s done or left undone—if Duke was his
name, which I take leave to question. ’Twixt you and I, I
doubt if it would pay to work Brazil. But, as I said, I bought
it as a going concern, lock, stock——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And lies,” snapped the Deacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flippance turned his large red face benevolently towards
the moleskins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lies is a harsh word. Legends, old cock, legends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi bain’t a bird,” rasped the Deacon. “Stick to the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord love us, a Quaker!” Mr. Flippance winked at Will,
who smiled—man of the world to man of the world. “As if
anybody would take a thing that size and smell for a rooster!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Deacon reached for the rum-bottle in deadly silence. Will,
with a fear—soon proved superfluous—that he meant it for a
missile, hastened to remark that anyhow there were no crowned
heads in Australia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where were you educated, sonny?” retorted Mr. Flippance.
And he began whistling the then favourite air: “The King of
the Cannibal Islands.” He broke off to point out that kings
and queens were as thick in the man-eating islands round
Australia as old cocks in Essex, though they didn’t wear moleskins,
or indeed anything but their own skins. Besides, he
added as an afterthought, wasn’t Queen Victoria monarch of
Australia too?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will, taken aback again, had to admit it. “But you haven’t
played before Victoria?” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flippance winked more widely as he explained that a
study of the posters would show that the Marionettes themselves
never claimed to have performed before crowned heads. It was
the plays that had been performed. He turned suddenly upon
the rum-soothed Deacon. “You’re not denying, my Quaker
friend, that Queen Victoria’s seen <span class='it'>Hamlet</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You leave me and the Queen out of it,” growled the Deacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Then you admit she’s seen <span class='it'>Hamlet</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi don’t know nawthen about it. Why <span class='it'>should</span> she see
<span class='it'>Hamlet</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he was the Prince of Denmark,” said Tony, winking
again at his now bosom friend. “But you Methody Quaker
dead-alive go-to-meeting sons of Sundayfied slugs crawl about
thinking yourselves holier than Victoria, God bless her, even
when it’s wood, never having seen society or ever had a drink
outside Chipstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Deacon was roused at last. “Never had a drink outside
Chipstone!” His breast heaved with a sinister movement—was
it a wheeze of wrath or of laughter? “Oi’ll goo bail my
round is bigger nor yourn. There ain’t scarce a barn in East
Anglia what don’t know me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s great jaw fell. “A barnstormer! You! Rats!
What do you play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t play—it’s work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know—but what’s your repertory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi bain’t onny a piece-worker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what you said. It ain’t always per tail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Retail, do you mean?” said the puzzled Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will, who had listened to the conversation with an ever-expanding
grin, here burst into a guffaw. Tony turned on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he kidding me?” he asked half angrily, half amicably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The answer—like Will’s departure from this enthralling parlour—was
staved off by the advent of yet another head popped into
the doorway. This time it was a heavily greased head with
scrupulously parted hair, and was attached to a spruce young
man with a spring posy in his buttonhole. But his bear’s-grease
out smelt his primroses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Tony!” cried the aromatic apparition. “Up
already!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I’ve</span> got to work for my living,” Mr. Flippance retorted.
“The dormouse season is over. You coming in, Charley, to see
the show to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! I’ve got better things to do, old boy.” The young
landlord turned to the Deacon. “Can you let me have five or
six live ’uns?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Deacon shook his head. “Oi don’t want to disoblige
brother. Oi do my duty according to Peter—‘nat’ral brute
beasts made to be taken and destroyed’—but they bain’t meant
by the Almoighty to be taken for sport, and Oi don’t howd with
fox-hunting neither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I see.” Mr. Charles Mott glanced glumly at the backs of
the pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef you want to be riddy o’ warmints, shoot ’em, says Oi, or
nip their brushes in traps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, oh!” came involuntarily from Will at this blasphemy.
The Deacon transfixed him with his glittering eye, but went on
without pausing: “And ef you want to be riddy o’ rats, come
to me. Don’t set a-worshippin’ your prize-terriers, like Ephraim
jined to his idols.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did come to you to be rid o’ the warmints, and now I want
half-a-dozen spunky ’uns. Make your own price, but if you
won’t supply ’em I’ll get ’em from Bill Nutbone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s doubly sinful—to goo to the heathen.” He turned to
Will. “Ef you’re so fond o’ ferrets, young man, Oi could spare
you this pair—cheaper than you’ll get ’em from Nutbone.” He
let their pink eyes protrude from his pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will eagerly closed with the offer. If Frog Farm proved as
dull as he was now beginning to fear—after this contrast of
Anthony Flippance and Joshua Mawhood—ratting or rabbiting
might be a providential diversion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t carry them in <span class='it'>my</span> pockets,” he said impressively.
“Just made by Moses &amp; Son, London. And I’ve got a long
walk. Besides, I’d like them in cages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll send ’em by the carrier on Friday,” promised the ratcatcher.
“Frog Farm, you said. Good day to you, Brother
Mott.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good day, Deacon. Sorry we can’t do business. Queer old
cuss,” he said, winking at Will as the door closed. “Belongs to
the Peculiars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’ve heard of them.” Will coloured a bit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony, who had listened to the dialogue with enlightenment,
here stalked out in half-genuine horror: “Holy Moses &amp; Son!
The publican and sinner prefers rats to Shakespeare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stow it, Tony!” called the landlord after him. “One
preacher’s enough.” And, smiling, he changed the blanks into
hunting pictures almost as deftly as his waiter would have
done it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had scarcely effected the transformation, however, before
the Deacon popped his head in again. Mr. Mott looked like a
caught schoolboy, but though the beady eyes looked straight
at the flamboyant hunters, Mr. Mawhood only said: “Oi forgot
to lend a law-book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of a law-book d’ye want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Gentry’s got a counter-claim. Ef Oi won’t pay for my
wife’s silk dress as Oi never ordered, she says my ferrets killed
her chickens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not a counter-claim, Mr. Mawhood,” advised Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a lyin’ claim, anyways. What killed her chickens was
her own black devil, Squibs. Her and her angels!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go down to the bar and see if the missus can find you a
book—but wouldn’t a lawyer be better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good Lord forbid! Oi’d sooner goo to a doctor. Well,
thank you kindly, brother—one good turn desarves another.
Foive, Oi think you said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or six. First thing in the morning. Spunky ’uns, remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Deacon sighed and disappeared again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old chap!” Sure of his rats, Mr. Mott was now
touched to sympathy. “His missus is a Tartar, no mistake.
Still with them rounds of his, he dodges her a good deal.” And
he sighed like the Deacon and followed him—bear’s-grease after
aniseed—and Will, alone at last, followed too, though without
a sigh, being still—as the waiter said—“one of the lucky ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the corridor he turned the wrong way, finding bedroom
doors instead of the staircase. He paused a moment to gaze at
a stuffed specimen of the sacred animal that stood with brush
rampant against a scenic background under a glass case, and a
stuffed trout that swam movelessly through a mimic stream.
Then he became aware to his surprise that Tony Flip, still in his
dressing-gown and still hugging the balance of his posters, was
pacing the corridor restlessly, like a caged lion, though it turned
out to be really like a tame creature denied his cage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t let me in,” he said miserably. And he indicated
an open bedroom door opposite the fox, with a view of housemaids
at work, angry at the hour. One was making his bed,
thumping it viciously; another raised swirls of dust with a
broom. Slops stood blatantly around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t even take free seats,” he groaned.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“What did I tell you?” said Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it ain’t because they think it wicked, the hussies. They
turn up their noses at it, just because it’s <span class='it'>under</span> their noses. If
they had to go to Greenwich Fair to see it, they’d fight to get
in. Candidly, cocky, have you ever seen a better bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems only too much,” ventured Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It don’t say all at the same performance. In practice it all
comes down to <span class='it'>The Mistletoe Bough</span>, the silliest of the lot, a bride
who shuts herself in a chest for fun, you know, and moulders into a
spirit. But think of Richardson’s—what they cram into twenty-five
minutes! You saw that at Greenwich, I suppose, Easter
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I only got to London in time for the Great Exhibition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been to that?” The Showman’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I came back for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a Show!!” And a note of immeasurable envy mixed
with the rapture of the rival impresario. “But what a chance
missed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No drinks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got lemonade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not a drink—that’s a gas. Lord, I thought, looking
at that bumper house, with a proper Christian bar, they could
pay off the National Debt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve seen it then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there at the opening. Stood so near the Royal Party
I patted the head of little Wales, and the Goldstick and Chamberlain
walking backwards from the Presence nearly shoved me
into the Chinese Ambassador just as he was salaaming on his
stomach. Didn’t little Albert Edward look sweet in his Highland
costume?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t inside then,” confessed Will, “and I only had eyes
for the Queen and her cream-coloured horses. You’ve got a
season ticket, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the Prince Consort’s compliments. The fact is, I
supplied the elephant for the Queen’s howdah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, didn’t you see it in the Indian compartment? They
wanted to show off the magnificent trappings she got from the
Rajah, and they thought of getting a real live elephant, which
would have been no end of trouble amid all those precious vases.
But I happened to know of a stuffed elephant at a show down
here in Essex, so I entered into correspondence with Buckingham
Palace and loaned the beast for the season—buying him up first,
of course—and sent him up in my caravan that had to be roused
from its winter sleep and completely unpacked. Yes, trouble
enough! But talk of the Koh-i-noor, that elephant’ll be worth
his weight in gold when he comes back—Queen Victoria’s
elephant as visited by the nobility and gentry of the world. I
annex the Great Exhibition. See!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I’d noticed him,” said Will wistfully. “I only saw
her statue in zinc, seven yards high. But there’s so much to
see—machinery and jewels and Mexican figures, it makes your
head ache, and I couldn’t even get a look at that Koh-i-noor,
such a crush round it. But did you see the Preserved Pig?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Showman’s eyes twinkled. “Mr. Woods, d’ye mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Woods?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Chancellor of the Exchequer. Haven’t you noticed how
they’ve left off abusing the income tax now they’ve got the
show to talk about? By Jove,” he chuckled, “what a haul for
the Exchequer if they bring the Crystal Palace under the
window tax!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! Best Berkshire breed. The real marvel of the
Exhibition! None o’ your stuffed creatures, but a natural pig
cured whole. Weighs three and a half hundredweight; five foot
and a half from tail to snout. ’Twas done by a provision
merchant in Dublin—Smith—I took note of the name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That name will be immortal,” said Mr. Flippance gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and there was a monster pigeon-pie!” said Will with
the same unsuspicious enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The church clock, striking four at this point, made the Showman
bound frantically to his doorway. “Not done yet, you
snails and sluts! When am I to get these bills to the tent? Do
you realize we open to-night? You’ll ruin the show.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take them,” volunteered Will. “My road lays by the
field.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A friend in need is a friend indeed.” Tony thrust the
heavy roll effusively into Will’s hands. “Ask for my daughter—she’ll
help you to stick ’em up on the bill-boards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your daughter?” murmured Will. He would have resented
his sudden reduction to a bill-poster but for the romantic vision
of the Bohemian petticoat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t pull the strings on both sides of the stage at once,
can I? Not to mention the women’s and boys’ voices, and the
piping Gaffers. Lord, she’s got a head on her, has Polly. And
pops in and out to play the piano too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With pleasant flutterings of the springtide fancy, the young
man lightly strode with his roll under his arm to the field where
a long chocolate-coloured caravan—apparently the vehicle that
had transported the elephant—stood horseless at an aperture in
the mammoth mushroom described by Tony Flip. Labourers
in shirt-sleeves were carrying in ropes and rough benches. Small
boys and large dogs stood around, and there was a litter of
straw, cardboard, shivered packing-cases, and dirty paper. Two
trucks covered with tarpaulin, and a vast box with a high-pitched
roof marked “Duke’s Marionettes,” completed the confusion.
Will, peeping in, saw a stage already set, at the border of which
a girl on her knees was tacking a row of tin footlight-holders.
The rear was already roped off, and the benches seemed to rise
like a gallery. Evidently the thing was done in style—crowned
heads or no crowned heads. Not without a thrill he walked in,
and across the grassy floor, but romance fled when the girl,
raising her head, presented a face almost as massive as her
father’s, and ravaged by smallpox to boot. Polly had indeed
“a head on her,” he thought, though long pendent ear-rings
preserved its femininity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Politely concealing his chill, he murmured “Miss Flippance,”
and explained he had been instructed to deliver the bills to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She received them and him with an indifference that would
have been galling had she been prettier, and was not gratifying
even from a massive brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly nonsense!” she grumbled, unrolling them. “To open
before you’ve done your posting and circularizing. There won’t
be a soul!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, surely—this weather!” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Flippance threw him an annihilating glance. “If dad
once gets an idea into his head, you can’t get it out with a
forceps.” Will stared at this vigorous young lady, who, with a
poster unfurled in her hand, proceeded to yell directions and
rebukes at the bench-arranging clodhoppers. It was an insult
to his sex, he felt resentfully. No woman, however ugly, had
the right to order men about, men who were not even married
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nincompoops! They’ll never be ready for to-night,” said
Miss Flippance, acknowledging his existence again. “Would to
heaven dad had gone up to London to see the Exhibition—and
not hustled us like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he was there at the opening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Flippance stared at him. “Were you with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No such luck. I didn’t even see the stuffed elephant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he stuffed you with that?” Miss Flippance emitted a
mirthless laugh, and Will looked at once angry and sheepish.
“Not that way, you hulking brutes! Turn ’em round.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
besides, it’s ridiculous to give <span class='it'>Hamlet</span>. High art don’t take
south of Scarborough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I saw <span class='it'>Othello</span> in London last week,” he contradicted
sharply—she should see he was no mere gull: “And the pit was
packed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—in April. But try it in the dog-days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too warm, eh?” he sniggered. She turned away as from
an idiot. That hurt him more than having swallowed her
father’s royal rodomontade. Did she then think the plot of
<span class='it'>Othello</span> glacial? Or had she no sense of humour? Yes, that
was it—the sex had been denied the sense of humour. True, it
shrieked with laughter if you tickled it, but the tickling must be
physical. Ah, she was at it again, bustling and bullying the
superior sex. Well, <span class='it'>he</span> wasn’t going to paste bills under her.
Let that lazy liar of a Showman do his own dirty work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon,” he called out huffily, and walked out of
the great tent in a far less romantic mood than when he had
entered it. And then, as he came through the opening in the canvas,
his eyes nearly started out of their sockets: Daniel Quarles’s
cart stood outside the tent, and there, perched on the driving-board,
holding the reins, and calmly instructing the shirt-sleeved
yokels to deliver the big drum to Miss Flippance, was the girl of
the parcel-shed!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Before his eyes could return normally to their orbits or his
breath to his windpipe, the incredible vision had vanished.
Jinny had, in fact, had an overdose of commissions in the other
purlieus of Chipstone, and having fetched the drum from its
winter quarters as directed by Miss Polly Flippance that noon—it
had, in fact, been pawned, and the piano was still irredeemable—she
was hastening on her homeward circuit as fast as Methusalem
could be induced to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was that?” Will gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rustic who had received the drum looked at him with
unconcealed contempt. A man who did not know that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That war Jinny!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as if he had given his drum a terrific bang. Jinny?—Jinny
Quarles then! Who else? In the boom of that name
reverberated a clamour of memories and of emotions, old and
new. Images of a solemn-eyed mite, of a merry little maid, of a
sedate Sunday scholar, and of the amazing creature of to-day,
went all interflashing with one another. Yes, the little Jinny
who had shared the wagon and his secret with him that fateful
Sunday, and who if ever by a rare chance she had flitted across
his thoughts, figured always as this same little girl in her grand
pink Sunday pelisse, trimmed with pink velvet and fringes, was
now grown up; bonneted, bewitching, incredible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where—where was her grandfather?” he stammered.
“Asleep inside?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Asleep?” The rustic grinned. “A long sleep, Oi should
reckon. Whoy, we ain’t seen the Gaffer for years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t stand there gossiping.” It was the female martinet
at her sternest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not his fault,” said Will. “I was asking about old
Daniel Quarles. Is he really dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead? Not to my knowledge. At least I have never
noticed Jinny in black.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then where <span class='it'>is</span> he? Why isn’t he looking after Jinny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh? But he must be a hundred!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean to say he lets Jinny go out and do his job?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most natural person I should think,” said Miss Flippance.
“Really I haven’t time to discuss village carriers, if the show is
to open to-night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do be careful of that drum. No, not
inside, blockhead. Come back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the tambour-laden slave did not seem to hear, his affrighted
fellow-serfs yelled to him to bring the drum outside again, and
when he was come, the despot’s skirts rustled majestically back
into the tent—they were long and hunched out quite fashionably,
which accentuated the humiliation of the male element. But
Will remained at the tent door, like Abraham after an angel’s
visit, thunderstruck and dumbfounded, but with consternation,
not reverence. It was, he thought, the grossest carelessness that
had ever occurred in the history of the globe. A respectable girl
like that—why, what was the world coming to? Sent gadding
about the country like a trollop, perched up horsily behind a
carter’s whip—this was what little Jinny had been allowed to
grow up into! And that girl at “The Black Sheep”—she who
had looked so innocent, whom he had mentally seen as a May
Queen, crowned with garlands, dancing girlishly round a Maypole—this
was what lay under her poetic semblance. And at the
same time—pleasing and perturbing thought—both the unsexed
Carrier and the maidenly May Queen were in reality little Jinny:
no stand-offish stranger, needing deferential approach, but—in a
way—his very own: the meek poppet whose cheek he had always
pinched patronizingly, in whose eyes he had always seen himself
as a grown-up god.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Flippance, sweeping out again, and finding him still
hanging about, immovable, had a new thought. “Pardon me—has
my father engaged you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He coloured up in anger. “I brought his bills in passing—that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I thought you might be looking for a job. There’s this
drum, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could have knocked her down. But she was evidently
quite in earnest, this outrageous, humourless female, only second
in self-sufficiency to Jinny the Carrier. The world seemed
suddenly emasculated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m no musician,” he said surlily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you look a strong young man and it’s muscle we want,
not music. You’d only have to stand here about half an hour
a day. This afternoon, of course, you might join the Bellman
round the town—I’ve ordered him for five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Flippance,” said Will, mastering himself and speaking
with crushing dignity, “have you observed my clothes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t matter,” she assured him. “We provide the
uniform.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I look,” he snorted, “like a drummer at a dime show?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ve come as a walking gentleman,” replied Miss
Flippance simply, “you’ve come to the wrong shop. We’re only
wires.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know all about that.” And he slashed savagely with
his stick at the insulting tambour, which uttered a bass roar of
agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid! But you might have smashed it!” cried Miss
Flippance. “Where’s the drumstick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I the drumstick’s keeper?” he answered, with an odd
Biblical reminiscence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nincompoops! Thickheads! Zanies! Where’s the drumstick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nobody had seen the drumstick. Jinny hadn’t brought
it, the slaves assured her. She assured them, still more emphatically,
that they had dropped it off the drum in taking it out.
And no inch of it being visible where the cart had stood, she
drew the deduction that it was now speeding towards Long
Bradmarsh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to Will. “Do run after her—the men are so busy—she
can’t be far, and she has to stop every now and again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glared at her. Then something inside him whispered that
that was the obvious thing to do—impishly to pretend to obey
her, and then to keep her waiting for the drumstick—eternally.
Yes, he would be revenged on behalf of his sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yoicks! Tally-ho!” he cried with an advent of glee that
he felt justifiably malicious. And, waving his own stick wildly,
he bounded with mock frenzy towards the field gate by which
the cart had gone off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t catch her like that,” bawled Miss Flippance after
him. “Across the fields! Head her off!” But he would not
take orders from any woman, he told himself, so feigning deafness
he ran doggedly into the Long Bradmarsh road, and turning a
sharp elbow, felt his heart leap up to see the now familiar cart
at a standstill before a wayside cottage. But even as he gazed
it started afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tore on madly. The back of the tilt vanished round
another bend. “Following a drumstick” passed grotesquely
across his mind. What an odd home-coming! What a queer
renewal of acquaintance with Jinny—after that solemn oath-taking
in the wagon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he heard a wild scampering through the bushes on
his right, and his canine friend of the inn was leaping and frisking
and joyously barking beside him. They ran together—owing to the
dog’s leisurely tangents and curvatures he could just keep up with
it. But with the sweat now pouring from his forehead, the inner
imp began asking what he was running for, since he had already
deceived and chastised Miss Flippance, left her eternally expectant.
Why not now drop into the pleasant saunter home he
had planned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the poor dog was panting in this heat—he answered the
imp—it must have run miles since its meal in the parlour.
Apoplexy threatened perhaps, hydrophobia even. Look at its
lolling tongue! He snatched it up: it must be restored to its
inconsiderate mistress, to whom, at the same time, a still more
important rebuke could be administered, if indeed any vestiges
of decency yet remained in the minx. But the little terrier
struggled spasmodically in his arms—the ungrateful brute! He
must save it from itself, then, just as he must save its mistress
from herself. Clamping it to his breast with iron muscles, he
toiled frenziedly forwards. Then the far, faint sound of a horn
came like elfin mocking laughter on the sultry air, and with a
sudden convulsion the animal wrested itself free, and Will was
left hopelessly pursuing, not the cart, but the dog. He had
indeed the pleasure of seeing the former slacken to receive the
latter, but the vehicle was wafted away again so smoothly that
to the poor perspiring pedestrian Methusalem appeared in his
original Mazeppa rôle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chase ran along wide horizons—great ploughed lands or
meadows with grazing cattle—the level broken only by ricks,
roofs, and trees, mainly witch-elms, with a few poplars. Sometimes
these elms clustered in groves, sometimes a few helped to
make the hedge-line; as often they rose solitary in arrogant
individualism. To the right was a delicious sense of the saltings
and of mewing sea-birds; and mysteriously, as in the heart of
the fields, red-brown barge sails or the tall, bare poles of vessels
could be seen upstanding. And once where the road mounted,
Will caught a glimpse of the Blackwater, and ships floating, and
the dim, blue shore beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at the top of this hill he was too breathed to continue.
He sat down, wiped his forehead, and surveyed the view; far
from soothed, however, by its simple restfulness. If only his
father had come to meet him, as his letter had requested, he
thought savagely, all this wouldn’t have happened!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Anyhow there was no need to follow the glaring high road any
longer. On the left he could see the clump of Steeples Wood,
and he knew that once he had cut through that, he could find
the swift field-path through Hoppits that would save miles of the
high road and not bring him out on it till the Silverlane Pump.
He strolled with a sense of relief towards the wood, but hardly
had its green groves closed refreshingly upon him when, reminding
himself he was a trespasser, he quickened his pace again, and
hurried through the oak plantations and over the wonderful
carpet of bluebells with but a slight eye to the sylvan beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even when he reached the field-path bounded by the ditch
and the dog-rose hedge, he did not relax his speed, having
bethought himself that the poor horse would surely be given
drink at the trough of the Silverlane Pump, and that there
would probably be a delay at “The Silverlane Arms,” even if he
should not have succeeded in heading the Carrier off altogether.
And from that point she would surely need his protection, so
lonely was the road till you sighted Long Bradmarsh with the
drainage windmills and the bridge. And the no less necessary
sermon could be combined with the protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found the wheel of the village pump chained up. Evidently
the water was running scarce. It looked not unlike a gibbet,
this tall pump, and he could imagine a criminal dangling from
the spout. There was little water in the trough, and the water-butt
of the inn was almost equally dry; a wayside mudhole
haunted by geese represented a pool. He remembered these
arid villages in such strange juxtaposition with his own oozy
birthplace—was it here or at Kelcott that he had made a boyish
fortune, bringing water at a halfpenny a pint? His mother, he
recalled with a faint smile, had been against the business because
Jesus had said to the woman of Samaria “<span class='it'>Give</span> me to drink,”
though he had trumped her text with the injunction to the
Israelites: “Ye shall also buy water of them for money.” It
all made him super-conscious of thirst, and he went into the inn,
and ordering a pint of ale, inquired if the Carrier had passed by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way be you a-gooin’?” said the tapster. It irritated
him to be questioned, and he replied tartly that he was going
home. He gulped down his liquor and put his question to a
group of children playing around the pump. They scratched
their heads and gaped at him, and the youngest put shy, chubby
hands to its smeary face. “The white horse and the girl!” he
explained, and the shy child started screaming, and a woman
burst from a cottage door and dragged it within, glaring suspiciously
at the “furriner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A labourer riding a plough-horse barebacked, and leading
another, came from the Bradmarsh direction. “Has the Carrier
passed you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’ye want a lift?” was the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lost his temper. “Haven’t you got enough business o’
your own?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much,” said the labourer naïvely. “Ground be as ’ard
as the road. Curous, baint it, arter all that soakin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He replied more civilly, glad his rudeness was misunderstood.
“Yes, it’s always either too little or too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And ye can’t sow unless ’tis none-or-both,” added the
philosophic ploughman, plodding on. “Gimme a followin’
toime!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rustic meant a season in which rain and sunshine came in
rapid alternation, but Will ruefully reflected that the “followin’
toime,” in the sense he was having it, was far from satisfactory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at that moment there was a cheerful bark, and that
inconsistent dog was curveting around him, its tall thumping
wildly against his trousers in an ecstasy of recognition. So he
was too late, he thought with a strange heart-sinking; knowing
its rearguard habit. He pushed it away with his foot. If the
beast thought he was going to carry it again, it was jolly well
mistaken. No more cart-chasing for him. His “following
time” was over. And as the creature persisted in gambolling
round his legs, he made a swish in the air with his stick to drive
it on its way, and it uttered a fearsome yell; it being part of
Nip’s slyness to cry before he was hurt. But for once Nip was
not a laggard, but an advance courier, and Fate brought
Methusalem round the corner at the exact instant of his yell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dare you strike my dog?” It was an inauspicious
reunion. Jinny had checked Methusalem, and her grey eyes
were blazing down from their dark lashes; her face framed in
its bonnet glowed like a dark flower, and he was confusedly
aware that that lonely hamlet’s high-street was suddenly pullulating
with people—the tapster and gapers at the inn door, the
ploughman looking backwards, excited at last, the little children
mysteriously out again with their mother, and other mothers
and infants (in arms or at skirt) surging agitatedly from nowhere,
whether at Nip’s cry or Jinny’s. Even the pump seemed to
have spouted an old man, while an old lady arose, like an ancient
Venus, from the pond. And every eye, he felt, was stabbing at
the maltreator of Jinny’s animal; the cackle seemed a sinister
clamour as of vengeance mounting from that swarm of sympathizers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t strike him,” he answered sulkily. Clearly she had
not recognized him—a position not without its advantages.
Doubtless the raw youth of her childish memories was effectually
buried beneath this manly form, set off by the elegant London
suit, this well-barbered head, and the face that had exchanged
freckles for the stamp of experience. “As a matter of fact,” he
added, “I fed the brute at the inn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which brute?” retorted Jinny sharply. But at this moment
Nip, who had been calmly lapping the dregs of the pool, intervened
by leaping up to lick Will’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” she murmured, coming to a standstill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Granted,” he said, not to be outdone in graciousness, and
beginning to enjoy the advantage her ignorance of his identity
gave him. “But that’s no proof I haven’t beaten him. You
remember the saying:</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all nonsense,” said Jinny, bridling up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He changed the subject quickly. “Have you got a drumstick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious! Do you want to try?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “It’s for the drum at the show. Miss Flippance
thinks you didn’t deliver it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it was tied on the drum. The fool of a man must have
dropped it—if he hasn’t poked it inside the drum. Did you look
under the benches?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. That’s it! I remember now seeing the man take the
drum inside by mistake. He must have dropped it on the
way back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think it would have been more sensible to look
before you leaped—especially such a long leap! And what a
pace you must have come in this heat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed faintly. “I’m a good walker. I know the cuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you get back as quick as you came, there won’t be
much time lost.” She clucked up Methusalem. “Good afternoon—hope
you’ll find your stick, and that you’ll drum-in a
good house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What! She too thought him capable of being a drum-banger,
a minion of marionettes. Had women then no eye—no perception
of clothes—as well as no humour? The mob was melting
away under their amiable parley, but he now rallied it afresh:
“Stop!” he called desperately after Jinny. “Stop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nip’s joyous bark at the resumption of the journey
drowned all lesser remarks, and again the cart receded on the
horizon—an horizon he knew houseless and arid, no region for a
lonely, good-looking girl. Let poor pockmarked Polly Flippance
brave the wild, if female carriers there must be: not his Jinny.
No, he must reveal himself at the next stop, he must remonstrate,
protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the trouble was that the thing would not stop, and that
there would be no stop now—he knew—for several miles. Perspiring,
panting, hallooing and waving his stick and utterly
oblivious of the scandalized street, he pursued at his swiftest, and
Methusalem being no serious competitor in the long run, Jinny
heard him at last, and looking back through the tilt over the
dwindled packages, saw the pitiful, gesturing figure, and to his
infinite relief the cart drew up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you lost now?” she called. “Your sandwich-boards?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going back to Miss Flippance,” he panted, “I’m
going Bradmarsh way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why ever didn’t you say so?” she replied calmly.
“Jump up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jump up? She asked a strange young man to jump up?
Then what else could she have done if he had said who he was—a
fact of which he had indeed been just about to make royal
proclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take passengers?” he gasped. He remembered now
that Joey had told him the cart would take him, but then he had
had no idea that “her” was not the vehicle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was equally surprised: “Why else did you run after me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Run after her? He did not like the phrase. Girls ran after
men—girls of a sort—to some extent girls of every sort: that
was the doctrine in <span class='it'>his</span> set. And yet he <span class='it'>had</span> run after her—it
called for explanation. “I wasn’t running after you,” he said
slowly, “it was only that—that I couldn’t believe my eyes to
see you like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like what?” She was frankly puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Driving about alone in this God-forsaken part. It’s—”
scandalous, he was about to say, but before the glimmering fire
in her eyes he altered the word—“it’s dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dangerous!” Her little laugh rippled out. “I thought
you said you knew these parts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I do—I’m an Essex man, even though I mayn’t look it,
having been half round the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you now? Well, it’s the big cities that are dangerous,
Gran’fer says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he’s right,” he admitted, wincing a little before the
candid grey eyes. “But don’t you understand that a woman
carrier is—” again he toned down his word—“outlandish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her amusement danced in her eyes. “Inlandish, I suppose
you mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t laugh,” he said, forgetting that the unrevealed Will
had no right to that tone. “You know it’s an unwomanly
occupation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laughing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what I mean. For one thing a woman can’t
know much about horses—and she oughtn’t to have to do with
’em anyhow—it’s not natural.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May she have to do with donkeys?” Jinny inquired
sweetly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He frowned. “Chaff’s no good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I never give my horse any—do I, Methusalem dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such word-mockery was bewildering to his simpler brain. He
opened his mouth, but nothing came, and his vexation only
increased for finding no vent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May she have to do with pigs?” queried Jinny again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pigs are at home,” he conceded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always,” she said demurely. “I meet lots on this very
road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you might meet worse than pigs on a lonely road like
this—you might meet men——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like I’ve met one now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but it happens to be me!” he said, again all but forgetting
her ignorance of his identity. “Usually it would be
dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but wouldn’t it be just as dangerous for a male
carrier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. He can fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if he met a woman?” she said slyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no danger in a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why are you running away from Miss Flippance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Flippance!” he cried in angry astonishment. “Who
says I’m running away from Miss Flippance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ve run from her to me. And if you say you
weren’t running after me, you must have been running away
from her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you try to bamboozle me. I tell you I’ve been half
round the world, and nowhere have I seen a woman carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d ha’ stayed at home you would have,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it seems. And in America there are those Bloomerites—come
over here, too, I hear, nowadays, the hussies. Want to
wear the breeches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they?” inquired Jinny with genuine interest. “I’ve
often thought it would be more convenient for me jumping up
and down, and there would be yards of stuff less. Some of those
Chipstone ladies quite scavenge the streets with their long skirts,
padded out by all those petticoats, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grew almost as auburn as his hair: such secrets of the
toilette, babbled by a young girl he still thought good at heart,
outraged his sense of decorum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t think!” he answered angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, try,” she suggested sweetly. “Put yourself into our
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s you putting yourselves into <span class='it'>our</span> place that’s the trouble,”
he retorted. “What will women be up to next, I wonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here it was Jinny’s turn to flare up. She had never—it has
been already remarked—thought of herself as up to anything,
rarely even thought of herself as a woman, least of all as a representative
of her sex. But challenged now to her face for the
first time, she felt she must hold the pass for all womanhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We women will be up to whatever we please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if you want to please the men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s young face flashed fire and roses. “And who wants
to please the men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed complacently. “I never met a woman who
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s fire died into cold contempt. “I don’t think you
know much about women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? Why, I’ve knocked about since you were in pinafores—and
pelisses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t be surprised, Mr. Drummer,” said Jinny with
judicial frigidity, “if you knew less about women than I know
about horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen half the world, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flicked up Methusalem. “But not the better half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced again. “Fiddlesticks!” was all he could find to
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drumsticks!” rejoined Jinny gaily, and with a mocking
flourish of her horn, she receded afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something stronger than his will now shot him forward crying:
“I say, Jinny!” He meant by crying that old familiar name
to disclose himself, and then to have it out with her, side by side
on the driving-board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her head. “<span class='it'>Do</span> you want to jump on or don’t
you?” she called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the last straw. Jinny—he had forgotten—-was not a
name privileged for the friend of her pelisse and pinafore days:
any male might use it, just as any wayside rough might abuse
its owner. “I don’t,” he shouted savagely. “I’ll never
patronize a woman carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A dashing young lad from Buckingham!</span>” She had started
singing, whether to herself or at him, he could not tell, and he
strode behind the cart almost as rapidly as Methusalem before
it, to find out whether she was still answering back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But apparently she had forgotten him—that was the most
pungent repartee of all—and the gaiety of the chorus only added
salt to the smart:</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The thin silver treble reminded him incongruously of her
Sunday-school singing, and the revival of that long-faded picture
of himself driving her home only emphasized the jarring present.
He turned furiously down Plashy Walk, where the rollick of the
chorus soon ceased to penetrate and the white fragrance of the
wonderful hawthorn avenue made a soothing passage-way. His
tongue felt acrid with anger, ale, and running, and Frog Farm,
with the faces of his parents, now began to loom more emotionally
before him, because of the tea as well as the tenderness awaiting
him. For neither of these luxuries was likely to be absent, even
if his letter—or his father—had gone astray. Let her protect
herself, this minx of a carrier, Time’s odd changeling for his
sober little Jinny. Serve her right if some horrid instrument of
fate should take down her pride!</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time he had come through the mile of hawthorn, and
defied the Plashy Hall dog with his stick, she had passed out of
his thoughts, and his indignation against her had changed to
indignation against the impudent attempt—obvious from the
notice-boards—to deny him and the public this old-established
right-of-way. Things would not have got even thus far had <span class='it'>he</span>
remained in Little Bradmarsh, he was thinking, and he was
already brooding over a plan of campaign as he was climbing
over the stile back into the high road. And then his vaulting
leg remained suspended an instant in air in sheer astonishment.
Jinny was facing him from her perch of vantage, smiling sweetly
from her witching bonnet, her cart athwart the road, in fact he
could hardly step off the stile without treading on Methusalem’s
toes. Relaxing his motion, he sat down on the stile, staring
at her.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Will!” exclaimed Jinny, and there was now a strange
softness in her face and voice. “How stupid of me not to
recognize you when I’ve got your box all the time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind, still perturbed about the right-of-way, and bent
now upon home, could not adjust itself so suddenly to the new
situation. Again his mouth opened without issue. Her smile
faded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Daniel Quarles’s granddaughter,” she said with a little
quaver. “Little Jinny of Blackwater Hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’ve remembered me at last!” His voice came out
harsh, though inwardly he was melted by this new sweetness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then did you know <span class='it'>me</span> all the time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—the moment I clapped eyes on you.” He was not
consciously romanticizing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’ve been thinking as I waited here for you. I’m
so glad. Because that shows you were only teasing me, saying
all those horrid things.” Then a new thought struck her to
self-mockery. “Of course—I’m getting silly—it wasn’t so
wonderful of you recognizing me, with the name of Daniel
Quarles on the cart.” And she laughed merrily. “Do you
know why I didn’t recognize <span class='it'>you</span>? It wasn’t only Miss Flippance
put me off, and that I couldn’t connect you with drums and
marionettes—it was you yourself that blocked the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old you, I mean—I was thinking about him all the time
we were talking, and that funny new you wasn’t like him one
bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thinking of me!” He was touched.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Whatever made
you think of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I just tell you I’ve got your box? And of course I
knew you were coming back. We’ve been expecting you for
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then mother did get my letter!” His latent ill-humour
flowed into the new channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why didn’t dad come to meet me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mouth twitched humorously at the corners with the
suspicion the letter was still unread, but she replied: “I suppose
because he’s old and hasn’t got a trap any more, and he knew
that Tuesday was my day. Jump up, I’m ever so late!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “I can’t jump up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what’s the matter, Will?” Her voice was anxious
and tender. “Have you hurt your ankle, running?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” he said petulantly. “Didn’t you hear me say I’d
never patronize a woman carrier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled in relief. “Yes—I heard you say it. But that
was the silly you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face hardened. “Silly or sensible, I stick to my word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drumsticks!” she mocked again. “Jump up and tell me
all about your affair with Miss Flippance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be saucy, Jinny. It don’t become you:”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the life of him he could not accept her as grown up, much
less as an equal, though she sat on high, dominating the situation,
whip in hand and horn at girdle, spick and span and cool; while
he, astride the stile, was a forlorn figure, with dusty shoes and
hot, lowering look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It becomes me as much as silliness does you,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see the silliness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you can’t live a week at Frog Farm without patronizing
me. Who else is there? There isn’t hardly a trap to be had
even miles around. Why there was a young man I drove out to
Frog Farm last week, and a fine to-do he had getting home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not calculated to soothe him. “And what need had
you to drive a young man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was for Maria—your mother’s pig. She was ill; her
whole litter might have been lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He frowned more darkly. Pigs, he had but just admitted,
might reasonably come into the feminine ambit: still, if girls did
get to know coarse facts, they might at least have the decency
not to talk about them. “And did he call you Jinny?” he
grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t call me Maria.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, traps or no traps,” he said sullenly, “you’ll get no
orders from me. I’ve fended for myself in the Canadian backwoods,
where there wasn’t even a woman to sew on buttons, and
I certainly don’t need one now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was still smiling. “Do you know the song of the
dashing young lad from Buckingham?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know <span class='it'>you</span> do. But what’s that to do with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She re-started the merry tune, but markedly altered the words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have my trunk at once!” he cried furiously, and sprang
off the stile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Fol de rol arilol lay!</span>” she wound up with easy enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me my trunk,” he commanded again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—on this lonely road—in this weather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my business!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t—it’s mine.” She touched up Methusalem and
turned his eager nose homewards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will ran round with the turning animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me my trunk!” He was white with determination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t you call that an order?” She cracked her great
whip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang to the tail-board, hanging on by one arm, and
clutched at the trunk with the other, dragging it out. But he
had forgotten to reckon with the faithful guardian. Nip,
excited as at a rabbit, sprang from the basket in which he had
been resting his four weary limbs and growled ominously, and
as the burglarious arm did not draw back, the terrier—O almost
human ingratitude!—sprang at it and made his beautiful white
teeth meet in its fleshy middle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You little beast!” Alarmed more for his finery than his
flesh, he snatched back the elegant London sleeve and dropped
off the cart, which soon disappeared down a grim and lonely
lane.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>He examined the wound in his coat, and finding to his relief
that it could be neatly patched up, he stripped off the garment
and surveyed his abraded skin, tooth-marked and red-flecked;
Nip’s signature in blood. Then the horrible thought of hydrophobia—he
had witnessed a dreadful case in Montreal—popped
again into his mind: after all, it was as hot as July, and no
sane dog would have behaved so disgracefully! And then,
pricked up by the sound of the horn, which came vaunting and
taunting from the lane, he started running after the cart yet
once more: he must find out if the dog would drink. But even
the rumbling of the vehicle could no longer be heard, and he
was slackening hopelessly when he became aware how involuted
was this lane, and that by trespassing across a ploughed field he
could gain several furlongs. Bounding over the ditch with his
coat slung over his arm, and nearly tearing it afresh in breaking
through the blackberry hedge, he ran as recklessly as a fox-hunter
across the furrows, breaking out again like a footpad
when he heard Methusalem’s leisurely trot, and catching that
unreluctant animal by the beribboned headstall. Jinny manifested
no surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you’d get over your silliness,” she said, smiling.
“Jump up then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not jumping up!” He was angrier and hotter than
ever. “I’ve come to give your dog a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh? But we’ve passed ‘The Silverlane Arms.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is no joking matter. He must have water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t need any. Surely I can look after my own dog—that’s
not a man’s place, too, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not a question of that—but if he doesn’t drink, it may
be fatal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense. A kind cottager offered him water only a mile
back—he didn’t want it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What’s the matter? You’re
looking so strange.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Have you had a sunstroke?” The
alarm in her voice reflected the alarm in his face, and his alarm
was in turn augmented by hers. He had a weird vision of that
man in Montreal, thrown into convulsions by the sound of a
splash and trying to bite his attendants, and a ghastly memory
came to him of a Bradmarsh woman who had frizzled for her
foaming child the liver of the dog that had bitten it. “Suppose
your dog should be mad?” he asked, with white lips that already
felt frothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nip? Nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He bit me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so sorry. Where? Let me see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Nip never bites.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the more suspicious. Try him with some water, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where can I get water? Nip finds his own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean to say you don’t carry water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not a water-carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you laugh? It’s a question of life and death.
Surely there must be a pond somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know there’s nothing hereabouts. Why, you used to
come to Kelcott to sell water at a halfpenny a pint. Don’t you
remember? You bought me a monkey-on-a-stick out of the
profits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you babble! Then I must go in suspense?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drumsticks! Here, Nip!” The dog was in her lap in a
twinkling. She pulled off her driving-glove and thrust her
fingers into its mouth. “Bite, Nip, bite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will felt his first conscious flash of romance in all that fagging
chase. It was like dying together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nip’s teeth refused to close on his mistress’s fingers—instead
he growled ominously at Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bite, you naughty dog!” And she pressed his reluctant
teeth together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” She held down towards Will two fingers faintly
ridged in red and white. But instead of feeling a reassuring
sanity, an impulse he felt really mad streamed through his veins
to seize the little fingers in his strong hands and to pull her
down from the seat of the mighty, down towards the inner
breast pocket that held his bank-notes. But his stick and
his coat and Methusalem’s bridle, all of which he was holding
simultaneously, cluttered up his hands sufficiently to clog the
impulse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That proves nothing,” he said sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And wasn’t he lapping at the pool after you struck him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that’s true.” His face lit up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you did strike him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tease. Yes, I’d forgotten, he lapped then, or rather I
scarcely noticed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you shut your eyes when going for him, just like
a bull does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t go for him, I tell you. I just swished my stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you’d kept your eyes open, you’d have seen him
drinking and saved your fright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was disappointed as well as irritated. “Then when you
let him bite you, you knew there was no danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s <span class='it'>never</span> any danger on these roads—didn’t I tell you
so? Why, there was more danger in that monkey you gave me,
for I sucked the paint off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t remember giving you any monkey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t want a monkey, but you <span class='it'>made</span> me take it—like that
oath in the wagon. Perhaps you’ve forgotten that too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can remember giving you a kiss,” he jerked defiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I can’t remember,” said Jinny quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose you’ve had so many since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lots!” said Jinny. “Good-bye again, if you’re so silly.
Gee up, Methusalem!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he clung to the bridle and was dragged along, to Nip’s
shrilled agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let go,” said Jinny. “Don’t be silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not till I have my trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s sillier still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me my trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you <span class='it'>have</span> gone mad, Will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not your affair, Miss Quarles, I want my trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was ordered to deliver it at Frog Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I order you to deliver it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let go.” She cracked her whip in his direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You little spitfire! If you touch me with that whip I’ll
have an action against you—as well as against your dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let go my horse then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m within my legal rights, as any <span class='it'>male</span> carrier would know.
I demand my trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I demand my horse. Let go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t.” He was running along with it now, keeping pace
with the mystified Methusalem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Will!” she cried. “And <span class='it'>you</span> said that on a lonely road
I might meet a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—you have now!” he said viciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—the first in all my life to give me trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That hurt worse than any whip. He loosed the festive bridle,
staggering a little, and the cart rolled past him. Only what was
that little object in the road?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, in the altercation she had forgotten to put on her glove
again after that dramatic offer of her fingers to the dog—it had
tumbled down. ’Twould pay her out to lose it, he thought
savagely. However, he thrust it into the inner waistcoat pocket
where his paper fortune reposed so comfortingly. But as again
he saw the tail-board with his now protruding box vanishing
round a corner, a blind rage began to possess him. Surely he was
not thus entirely to be thwarted and overridden. Surely, at
least, he would not endure her actual delivery of his box at Frog
Farm. No, he must head her off again, if only outside his own
gate. Across his border a woman carrier must in no circumstances
be countenanced. And once more the unfortunate Will
Flynt ploughed through the hedges and meadows, not always
remembering the prickly places; and finally chased by a bull
on which he had to turn several times with his coat and his
stick, just like a toreador; though, remembering what Jinny had
just said about the bull shutting its eyes, he dodged it at the
charging crises, and thus saved both coat and skin. But he was
forced to scramble ignominiously over a fence into the high
road, still a good mile from Bradmarsh Bridge, at the very
moment the cart came clattering up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if Jinny had observed the Spanish bull-fight she gave no
sign. What she said, as she reined in Methusalem, was much
more surprising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been thinking you were within your legal right, Will.
I’m sorry. A carrier must deliver goods as ordered. So if
you’re still silly——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she had stopped before the final clause, he might have been
touched by the unexpected surrender. As it was, he only said
icily, “How much do I owe you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sixpence,” she said as frigidly, “unless you’d like a reduction
for my not taking it all the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you.” He passed the coin, grazing her warm
fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, you didn’t happen to see my glove?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your glove?” he repeated. Why, indeed, should he fetch
and carry for her? Let her be punished for her negligence. He
moved towards his box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well—I suppose it’ll be there on Friday,” she said.
“I’m the only person who ever goes that cut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drumsticks aren’t the only things that are dropped,” he
observed maliciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she agreed simply. She did not even seem to remember
how she had trounced “that fool of a <span class='it'>man</span>.” No sense of humour
in the sex, he reflected again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do hold the brute!” he cried, for Nip was again showing his
teeth in defence of the box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you kept off a bull, you don’t need protection against a
terrier,” she replied, and to his further amazement there was a
note of admiration in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The weaker the thing the harder it is to fight,” he rejoined
significantly. He had his back now to the cart, and he hoisted
his trunk upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not going to carry it?” There was incredulity in
her voice, for it was a box that looked nearly as long as himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who else?” He shifted the box to his right shoulder,
which he had padded with his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you’d go home and get a truck or something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And leave it on the road?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just as safe as my glove.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no safety for either,” he said oracularly, “if a man
like me comes along.” And he swaggered forwards with his
huge load.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you’re as strong as the bull!” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am.” He was flattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as obstinate as a mule!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He increased his pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Methusalem caught him up. “Since you <span class='it'>are</span> going to Frog
Farm,” said the Carrier, “why not take your folks’ groceries too?
I don’t usually get ’em till Friday, but when I got your order to
go there to-day——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I do your jobs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I told you. You can’t live a week at Frog Farm
without me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the parcel.” His forehead was already beaded with
perspiration, but his left hand heroically held out his stick:
“Slide the string on this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “<span class='it'>Still he’d sing fol de rol lay</span>,” she
trilled, and in a minute he was hopelessly left behind. The road
had already begun the ascent towards Long Bradmarsh, but he
heard her goading Methusalem to greater efforts, as though in
fear lest he should repent under the burden of his obstinacy.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as she was safely out of sight, Will, breathing heavily,
slackened his showy pace, and very soon lowered his load
altogether and sat down upon it, while he wiped his streaming
countenance. The physical relief was great. A lark was singing
overhead and his eyes followed it restfully till he couldn’t tell
whether the throb was singing or the song throbbing. He must
smoke his pipe by this wayside grass after all that scurrying and
squabbling. Fumbling for his matches, he felt the bulge of the
glove and softened still more. Anyhow he had been victorious
over the vixen, and he was resting on his laurels, so to speak.
Now that she realized he would never recognize her as a carrier,
he could afford to give her one of the Canadian fal-lals he
had bought at Moses &amp; Son’s for his mother, and which now
reposed in the box arching beneath him. That would make her
think he had not forgotten her even in Canada, and anyhow it
would show her he bore no malice for the bite or even for her
bark. Surveying the landscape, he recognized that by going
on a little he would strike the turning to the bridge and
“The King of Prussia,” where he might possibly find a trap.
The hussy need never know he had broken down. But as he
sat there lazily smoking and evoking his boyhood and her part
therein, the best part of an hour sped glamorously, and suddenly
he saw red. Caleb Flynt, equally coatless, was hastening from
the Bradmarsh direction as fast as his aged limbs could carry him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, dad!” he cried, startled. “Same old shirt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb grinned. “Keeps her colour, don’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why didn’t you come to meet me?” said Will, recalling
his grievance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi did—soon as Jinny come and told us she’d passed you
carrying your chest and you might want a hand. Is that the
hutch? Dash my buttons, you must ha’ growed up like Samson!
Fancy carryin’ that all the way from Chipstone in the strong
sun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will did not deny the feat—the explanation would really have
been too complicated. In his embarrassment, he overlooked that
his father had not really answered his question. “And how’s
mother?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother’s in a great old state. ’Nation mad with Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what’s Jinny done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sow neglectful. ‘Bein’ as you passed him by,’ says mother
to she, ‘why dedn’t you stop and pick up the chest?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked uncomfortable. “And what did Jinny say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said she dedn’t reckonize the old you when she dreft by,
and besides she was singing-like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced at the reminder of the song, but was grateful to her
for telling so truthful a lie: instinctively he felt that his folks
having accepted a woman carrier with such brainless acquiescence
would fail to enter into the fine shades of his feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother hadn’t a right to make a noise with Jinny,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She only kitched of a fire for a moment. ’Twas more over
you than over Jinny, Oi should reckon. Bust into tears, she did,
and when Oi said maybe as Jinny was mistook she nearly bit
my head off. ‘Too lazy-boned to goo and give a hand to your
own buoy-oy,’ says she. ‘Ain’t he shifted for hisself nigh ten
years?’ says Oi. ‘Can’t you wait ten minutes more? Oi count
he’ll be here before the New Jerusalem,’ says Oi. That dedn’t
pacify her much, bein’ a female. Cowld-blooded—she called me.
‘There’s feythers,’ says she, ‘as ’ud be trimmed out with colours
like Jinny’s hoss—not leave it to a gal as is no relation to decorate
even her dog in his honour.’ ‘That’s for May Day,’ says Oi.
‘All wery fine,’ says she. ‘But May Day’s over and gone six
days’—she’s a rare un for figgers is mother—‘time enough,’ says
she, ‘for God to create the world in.’ ‘Maybe you’d like flags
flourishin’ and flutterin’, says Oi, jocoshus like, ‘but Oi ain’t got
no flags save my old muckinger.’ And with that, bein’ more
shook than I let on, Oi blowed my nose into it, wery trumpet-like,
and that seemed to quieten her, for her tantarums be over
now, and the onny noise she’s makin’ is the fryin’ o’ them little
old weal sausages for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” cried the Prodigal Son, his face transfigured. “She
remembered my passion for veal sausages!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And there’s pickled walnuts too! Put them out likewise,’
says Oi, ‘for ’tis a poor heart that never rejoices.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s your passion, not mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what mother said. ‘But baint Oi to get no compensation?’
says Oi. And why dedn’t you write to her all these
years, Willie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face darkened again. “I’m no great shakes with a quill.
And there wasn’t anything to say. I did write once to tell you
I was safe across the Atlantic and was gone to make my fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We dedn’t never get no letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—it came back months after. I forgot to put England
on it, thinking maybe Essex was enough. But it seems there’s
a Mount Essex in the States, down Wyoming way, and the Yanks
always think everything is for them. So I thought I’d best let
things be, being on the go in those days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb fully sympathized with the plea. “And have ye made
your fortune, Will?” he inquired meekly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends on your idea of a fortune,” Will parried. But
he had a complacent consciousness of those bank-notes behind
the glove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My idea of a fortune be faith in God,” said Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, I know.” The young man got off the box impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb tugged at one of its handles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, that’s lugsome!” he said, letting the long heavy chest
subside. “Ef you ain’t come back rich, you’ve come back
middlin’ powerful. All the way from Chipstone!” He clucked
his tongue admiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having once left the miracle undenied, and feeling the situation
now altogether beyond explanation to the bucolic intellect, Will
again silently acquiesced in the Herculean imputation and took
the other handle. “But why didn’t you bring a cart or a
truck?” he asked as they began walking cumbrously towards
the bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t got nowt but a wheelbarrow,” Caleb explained. “Times
is changed—-Oi ain’t looker no more, and there’s two housen
now. Old Peartree got to have a separate door, but ’twas a
good bargain Oi put my cross to with the son o’ the Cornish
furriner what Oi warked for these thirty-nine year. Mother will
have it she’d ha’ made a cuter deal, she bein’ a dapster in figgers
and reckonin’ out to a day when the New Jerusalem will be
droppin’ down, but Oi don’t howd with women doin’ men’s
business, bein’ as your rib can’t be your head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite agree,” said Will, surprised to find such enlightened
sentiments in his queer old parent. “But tell me about Ben
and Isaac and the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t write neither. We was lookin’ to you to tell us
about the others as went furrin. Ben should be a barber in
America, and they say as Christopher’s got a woife, colour o’
coffee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, dad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe ’twas Isaac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No Flynt would marry a nigger woman,” said Will decisively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’m right glad to hear it,” said Caleb. “For Oi count the
young ’uns ’ud come out streaky and spotty like pigeons or
cattle, and though they likely turn white when they die, and
their souls be white all the time, Oi could never be comfortable
along o’ finch-backed gran’childer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With such discourse they beguiled the heavy way, trudging
behind their tall shadows, till at the gate of the drive of Frog
Farm they saw Martha peering eagerly along the avenue of
witch-elms. In another instant Will, letting go his box-handle,
was choked in her hug and wetted by her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can smell those sausages right here, mother,” he said, with
a smile and a half sob. “How do ye howd?” And he emphasized
the homely old idiom by patting her wrinkled cheek. She
caught his hand in hers, and he was touched by the thin worn
wedding-ring on the gnarled and freckled hand. His eyes roved
round. “But surely this ain’t the house I was born in. Why,
that was a giant’s castle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb looked a bit uneasy: “You’re sure this <span class='it'>be</span> Will?” he
asked Martha in one of his thundrous whispers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I’d know him in a hundred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s onny nine or ten.” And he laughed gleefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do be easy, Caleb. You’re getting as unrestful as Bundock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Will right enough,” Will intervened. “Only everything
seems to have got so small. Come along, dad.” He took up
his side of the box:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious goodness!” cried Martha, perceiving it at last.
“My poor Will! Lugging that from Chipstone! Why didn’t
you call to Jinny to stop and take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How was I to know that that was Jinny’s cart dashing by?”
he said, moving forward quickly. “I suppose you didn’t ask
her to stay for the sausages?” he added lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t ask her, dearie,” said Martha. “She was terrible
late, she said, and I know how crotched her wicked old grandfather
gets at feeding-time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How big she’s grown!” he observed carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big!” They both repeated the word, but from a different
surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said you didn’t see her,” said Martha sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw a big young woman flying by in the cart—I didn’t know
then it was Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you just said everything’s growed so little,” chuckled
Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it has—all except Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she isn’t so very big,” said Martha, “rather undersized,
some folks would say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m not so oversized myself,” said Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will’s seen her toplofty over Methusalem,” explained Caleb.
“Wait till he sees her on her pegs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I did see her on her pegs,” said Will, “at ‘The Black
Sheep’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why did you goo and carry that little old box?”
inquired Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wasn’t in the cart then—how was I to guess she was the
Carrier?” he answered crossly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you could ha’ ast for the Bradmarsh carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The coach was late,” he snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Jinny hadn’t started yet,” persisted Caleb. “Bein’ as
you seen her there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Legends, my boy, legends.” Tony Flip’s euphemism for lies
rang in Will’s brain. But legends, he was finding, are not easy
to sustain. One lie breeds many, and he was sorry now he had
allowed himself to be made a champion weight-lifter. “I
thought being so late ’twas no use asking for the Carrier—’twas
you I expected,” he said, turning the war back into the enemy’s
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they had now lumbered up with the box to the twin
doors, and the task of dumping down the subject of discussion
in a convenient place stayed the cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feast for the Prodigal Son had been laid in the parlour,
and the scent of the fried sausages came appetizingly on the
evening air, more poetic than any of Nature’s competing odours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there’s my letter!” cried Will at the parlour door,
beholding it on the mantelpiece. “You might have let me know
you couldn’t meet me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went in and took it down. “Not opened?” he cried
crossly, the muggy atmosphere of the sealed chamber adding to
his irritation. “And I told you exactly the day and hour I was
coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We haven’t had time to get it read yet, dearie,” said Martha
mildly. “I was going to take it to the dressmaker, but Saturdays
I’m so busy and Sunday was Sunday, and yesterday I felt as if
my ribs were grating together, and to-day was too hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I shan’t write again in a hurry,” he said peevishly, and
was about to tear the letter in twain. But Martha snatched it
from him with a cry and slipped it into her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Will,” she pleaded. “Your sausages are spoiling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Prodigal Son would not batten at once upon the fatted
calf. He felt too dusty, he said, and then, imperiously pushing
at the diamond-paned casement and realizing with disgust it
would not open, vanished in search of soap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t be well,” whimpered Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worrit, dear heart,” Caleb consoled her. “Oi count
even Samson wanted a wash arter he’d lugged that little old
gate up the hill from Gazy.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Time</span> hung heavy on Will’s hands the first few days of his return,
as heavy as the meals heaped before him by the adoring Martha.
There was as much for “bever” as for breakfast, yet quantity
did not suffice him. He became almost as finnicking and
fractious as Cousin Caroline, not content, for example, to strain
the pond-water through muslin for the larger insects, but insisting
on its being boiled: indeed hinting preposterously that the
mortality among his unknown brothers and sisters might have
been connected with potations on which Caleb and Martha had
patently flourished. He held views on the house-refuse, ignoring
Caleb’s plea that “the best drain be a pig,” and by making
hinges the very first evening for the lower windows to open by, he
had raised such a draught in the house that it was all they could
do to keep their bedroom and their kitchen air-tight, and even
Martha was glad when on the Wednesday afternoon he went
off to get some fishing in the Brad, and the windows could
all be closed up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the few dace and bull-heads that rewarded his rod left too
many intervals for reflection, and in the unsettlement of his
thoughts, before settling down to a judicious expenditure of his
ninety pounds, he felt he needed more deadening exertion. He
tried poling against the stream to that ancient faery island—somebody’s
half-decked shooting punt was doing no good rusting
on the bank in the off-season, he thought—but the process soon
became automatic and his mind was still restless, while after the
islands of the St. Lawrence this enchanted playground of his
youth seemed tame and its prettiness trivial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fed his fancy on a salt-water expedition for the Thursday:
recalled the great catches of flat-fish he and his brothers had
made, the sport to be got out of the voracious if inedible “bull-rout,”
but it would be a very long walk, and what if when one
arrived the tide should be too low? So he walked inland around
Bradmarsh Common. But though it was, he told himself, the
“old haunts” that he went out for to see, he omitted to revisit
that venerable landmark, Gaffer Quarles. Conscience adjured
him he ought to look up the old carrier, whether for respect or
reproof—and he actually did hover around Blackwater Hall—but
pride forbade his entering, lest he stumble upon the new
Carrier. The Hall appeared even more dwindled to him than
Frog Farm as he stood surlily surveying it; even the Common—after
the Canadian prairie—seemed no longer to roll towards the
blue infinities. He had a strong impulse to burst in on that
careless old Daniel and give him a piece of his mind, even at the
risk of meeting his gadabout granddaughter; but the bleating
of the goats sounded forbidding, and as he was hesitating he
found himself under the gaze of another gaffer, the crown of
whose battered beaver tied on to its brim with coloured strings
gave him a festal grotesquerie. Will remembered this ancient,
though despite his gay headgear he now seemed inexpressibly
grimy in his patched corduroys, his two ragged coats, and the
dirty towel wound round his throat. It was the Quarles’s
nearest neighbour, “Uncle” Lilliwhyte, who lived in a cottage
also on the Common; trading in cress, cherries, and mushrooms,
driving home obstreperous cows and doing other odd jobs. This
worthy was now exercising his equal right of gathering sticks on
the Common, and the sordid association seemed to reduce Jinny
to the same shrunken proportions as her cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buy a nadder, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir!” Yes, after all, his father had been a “looker,” not
a mere labourer, he himself had a waistcoat lined with bank-notes
and cut by Moses &amp; Son, why should he expect a sense of
dignity from a girl of so lowly a status? Let her earn her
livelihood as she wished—it was not his affair, except in so far
as she should have none of his custom. A cock crew lustily, and
it subtly heartened him up. Yes, he would go in now, give her
back her glove, professing to have just picked it up, and wash
his hands of her for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you, uncle,” he said, with an irrelevant memory of
the ancient’s blind mother, “what should I do with an adder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s a real loive nadder, just kitched, sir.” He
cautiously displayed its hissing head and darting tongue.
“There’s many a slowworm killed for a woiper, pore things.
Onny fowrpence, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here’s sixpence,” said Will graciously. “No, no,” he
explained hastily, as the ancient began handing over the wriggling
reptile. “Kill the beggar.” And he hurried homewards. On
second thoughts—inspired perhaps by some dim impression of a
female figure flitting among the clothes-lines behind the Hall—he
would not risk an encounter with Jinny, but make a special
call upon poor, lonely old Daniel on the morrow. Jinny would
then be out on her rounds. And if he took care to go at about
the hour she was due at Frog Farm, he could avoid her at
both places. Yes, that were tactics worthy of a man of the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Casual conversation with his elders reminded him, however,
that Jinny was not expected that Friday. She had already left
the parcel of groceries on the Tuesday. He was thus safe from
her for eight days—he had only to remain at home. But the
discovery that the whole of Friday was free from any possibility
of her appearance at Frog Farm, and that Blackwater Hall was
equally immune from her presence, seemed to remove the zest
of his diplomacy. Neighbour Quarles remained unvisited, his
solitude unmitigated, and Will wandered aimlessly on the high
road between Bradmarsh and Chipstone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The year was at its most beautiful moment. The hedges were
white with hawthorn, and the fresh young leaves on the
trees gave an exquisite sense of greenness without blurring the
structural grace of the branches, while the unspoiled cadence
of the cuckoo’s cry came magically over the sunny meadows.
But Will could only swish viciously with his stick at the hedges
and litter the lanes with ruined blossom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with no little surprise that, as he and his elders sat at
high tea on this same evening, they heard the windings of Jinny’s
horn. The three sprang up: then Will sat down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t you comin’ out to see Jinny?” asked Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the boy drink his tea,” said Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you ain’t never spoke to her yet,” persisted Caleb.
“And you used to give her eggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the boy eat his eggs himself,” said Martha sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi dedn’t mean they eggs,” laughed Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do go and see what Jinny can want,” Martha commanded him.
“I shouldn’t be surprised if it <span class='it'>is</span> eggs—now that Mr. Flippance
has opened his show he’ll be wanting them regularly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever for?” asked Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sucks ’em raw, like weasels, him and his darter,” explained
Caleb. “They should say it’s good for the woice, and by all
accounts showmen fares to have a mort o’ pieces to speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why doesn’t Jinny sell him her own eggs?” asked
Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know she has them?” asked Martha quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t she?” he said lightly, reddening like the comb of
the cock he had heard crowing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not enough. That old sinner eats her out of house and
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Flippance?” murmured Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no. Her grandfather. Why don’t you go, Caleb?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will sat on stolidly, helping himself to more tea and pouring
the milk into the slop-basin. Presently Caleb returned, announcing
that Jinny had brought something for Will—she could only
legally deliver it to Mr. Flynt, junior, she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will turned redder than at the egg-talk. “But I never
ordered anything,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t prewent folks sendin’ you presents, same as
they’re foolish enough,” Caleb reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fantastic fear that the blue-eyed girl of the train was discharging
some proof of devotion at him made him drum nervously
with his teaspoon. “But who knows I’m back home?” he
answered Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the open house-door came the gay strains of a fresh
young voice:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t she sing pritty?” sighed Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d sooner hear her singing about Zion,” said Martha. “She’s
rather flighty, to my thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the first time Oi heard ye say a word agen Jinny,”
said Caleb, “leastways behind her back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will, tingling between the two tortures—the song without and
the table-talk within—sprang up brusquely. “Drat the girl—my
tea’ll get cold. Sit down, dad, I’ll see what she’s brought.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny sat stiffly on her seat, Nip clasped in her arms. The
singing had ceased. Despite himself Will felt an odd pleasure in
the sight of the trim figure so competently poised above Methusalem,
and he was touched to note Nip’s tail agitating itself
amicably at the sight of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening,” she said politely. “I am glad to see it has
not developed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What hasn’t developed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your hydrophobia. And I am keeping the dog tight, you
notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced. “Oh, I’m not afraid of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am—he’s already bitten you once: get the cages,
please, while I hold him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cages?” He had a confused idea that Nip was to be
caged, was dangerous after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re near the tail-board. Nothing to pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went behind the cart, wondering, semi-incredulous; did
indeed perceive a couple of cages in the dusk, and reaching for
one, drew back his hand in a hurry from some darting, snapping,
creamy, pink-eyed yellowness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” he cried involuntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter? Oh, I had forgotten they bite too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this practical joke?” he cried angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” said Jinny. “Didn’t you order a pair of ferrets to
be sent by the Carrier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes grew wide. “I beg your pardon—I’d quite forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought Deacon Mawhood wasn’t a likely joker. Polecats,
he said. Have you got the cages?” she asked, not looking
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m—I’m getting them,” he stammered, and began cautiously
haling them towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Deacon asked me to say the hob and the jill must be
kept apart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” he grunted, almost as shocked as over her mention
of Maria’s litter. The impudicity of her calling was again borne
in on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything else?” burst from him sardonically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—except there’s no need to cope them. I don’t know
what coping is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s what you want,” he said brutally. “Muzzling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid of <span class='it'>my</span> bite, too?” asked Jinny, and turning towards
the interior shelf that held the smaller parcels, she began to sing
softly to herself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been expecting “Canada” at the end, and felt somehow
disappointed at its absence. “But when I gave the order,”
he rejoined notwithstanding, “I didn’t know that the Bradmarsh
Carrier was a girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That didn’t prevent you using her when you did know,” she
said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When have I used her?” he cried hotly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what about this?” She produced from the shelf in
the cart a long parcel half enclosed by a string in broken, dirty
paper, within which showed a layer of grimy straw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not my business.” She tendered it downwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never ordered this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t you better open it?” she asked with a twinkle. He
dumped down the cages violently, to the alarm of the ferrets, and
tore it open, only to shudder back before the clammy-looking
coils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An adder as well?” said Jinny. “You going to open a
menagerie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s dead,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you want a live one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t want one at all—I never ordered it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Uncle Lilliwhyte told me he sold it to you for fourpence
and you gave him twopence extra to kill it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon—he misunderstood.” It was his second
apology. “But what a dirty way to deliver it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you expect me to nurse a viper in my bosom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again this indelicate speech, hardly atoned for by its wit.
“The old ragamuffin!” he muttered furiously. “How did the
idiot know it was me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fellow-feeling, I suppose,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’re saucy again. You must have told him it was me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right for once. Honest uncle was upset at your forgetting
to tell him where to send your purchase. I was milking my
goats and saw you hanging about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he flushed uneasily. “And how much do I owe you?”
he asked hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twopence for the viper, being only a short way. The
Deacon says he prefers to pay the freightage on the ferrets, and
to collect it from you himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put down the straw-entangled snake on top of one of the
cages, and pulled out a coin. “Have you got change for
sixpence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless I loose Nip.” She fumbled with one hand in her
pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glowered. “Oh, next time will do,” he said angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then, there <span class='it'>is</span> to be a next time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so far as I am concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure you don’t want any more wild animals?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be so fierce. The drumstick is found, you will be glad
to hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the show is doing big business, Mr. Flippance tells me.
He was so set up he gave me a pair of new gloves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That old braggart! What business had he to give you
gloves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I lose one through his drumstick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then ’tis me ought to pay for them,” he protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You? What nonsense! Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was on my account you lost the glove—through trying to
get a bite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled. “You talk as if I were an angler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you were! Anything but a carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that. Would you like me to buy another pair of
gloves—on your account?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you would!” he said eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What size do you take?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stow that fol-de-riddling—you know I don’t mean gloves
for <span class='it'>me</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you taking back the order?” she said, with feigned
disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never gave you an order!” he said, goaded. “I’d cut my
tongue out sooner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your tongue between your teeth. You’ll want it to
give me an order with before you’re a week older.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! I’d as soon shoe a horse with a hairpin.” He
snatched up his cages decisively, one in each hand, and the
adder rolled on to the ground, bursting its strawy cerements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s grey eyes flashed steel-like. “And can’t I drive as
well as Gran’fer? And don’t I know the roads?” And she
uplifted her horn from her girdle and blew a resounding blast of
defiance. It set all the cocks crowing behind the house and
brought Caleb bustling from within it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you summon me, Jinny?” he asked. “Gracious, Will,
whatever you got there?” His eyes expanded to see the
sinuous animals swirling fiercely against their wires; in coming
nearer to peer at them, he stumbled over the snake and uttered
a cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” called Jinny. “It’s dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You killed it, Willie?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a drumstick,” said Jinny gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks, father!” said Will angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi don’t care what sort o’ stick you killed that with,” said
Caleb, “so long as it’s a dead corpse. But do ye come in now—mother’s
grousin’ about the tea gittin’ cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like cold tea. Go in, father. I’m just coming.” He
harked back to her blast of rebellion. “You may be able to
drive, and you may know the roads. But can’t you see how
unnatural it is, you perched up there and blowing a horn like
Dick Burrage of the County Flyer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do I blow it as fine as he?” she asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anybody can blow a horn,” he answered curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can they now?” She was piqued again. “I’d like to see
anybody do it. Why, Gran’fer can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gran’fer hasn’t got much breath left. I’m not talking of
men in their eighties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is in his nineties,” she corrected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. I meant anybody with proper lungs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can <span class='it'>you</span> blow it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t I be able to blow it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right! Blow it!” said Jinny gravely. She unslung it
with one arm and held it down. He gazed at it, taken aback,
sandwiched between his cages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no good opening your mouth,” she said. “I’m not
going to stick it in. You’ll have to put down those horrible
beasts and do that yourself. Why don’t they keep still? They
make my head ache.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved to the back of the house to place the ferrets out of
the way, kicking the poor adder before him—it was a needed
relief to his feelings. Returning, thus purged, he took the
proffered horn—it was not a professional coach-horn or post-horn,
but just the little instrument of a master of foxhounds curling
into a circle above—and with but scant misgiving put it to his
mouth, and blew. But the silence remained unbroken. He
puffed on and on with solemn pertinacity. Not a sound issued.
His cheeks swelled to bursting-point, and grew redder and
redder with shame and vexation. But silence still reigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t put it inside your lips,” corrected Jinny.
“Think you’re tum-tumming into a comb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He readjusted it sullenly, but the music within was still
coy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slacken your lip,” she advised. “Try to splutter br-r-r-rr
into it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whatever he spluttered into it, nothing came out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never realized it was quite so difficult, even the lipping,”
said Jinny simply. “Of course I didn’t expect you to do the
double or treble tonguing at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, tonguing?” he inquired morosely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dividing the notes. Say ‘Tucker, Tucker, Tucker’ into it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s blowing, not saying,” said Will obstinately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But secretly he modified his methods, and at last a ghostly
plangency or a staccato squeak began to reward his apoplectic
agonizings, and the still prisoned Nip, who had been yawning in
utter boredom, now accompanied the music with a critical and
lugubrious howling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon this spectacle and situation reissued the guileless Caleb,
and had the Crystal City itself come down upon earth, his eyes
could scarcely have orbed themselves more spaciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>didn’t</span> summon you,” observed the merciless Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away, father! What are you staring at?” yapped the
tortured young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do be a fine musicianer!” And Caleb grinned. “But
do ye don’t play now—mother’s gittin’ into her tantarums over
your tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The instrument must be out of order,” said Will, handing it
up crossly to Jinny. Remorselessly she drew from it a clarion call
that made the welkin ring and the poultry-yard respond in kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How the cocks crow!” she observed artlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thinks because she blows a horn she’s a devil of a fellow,”
Will remarked witheringly to his receding father. “Say, Jinny,
why don’t you wear the breeches?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like those Bloomerites you told me of? I will,” she
responded sweetly, “if you think it more becoming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! You don’t suppose <span class='it'>I</span> notice what you wear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how do you know I’m not wearing ’em now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have me there!” And he smiled despite himself. The
smile lit up the face under the aureole of red hair—it seemed to
Jinny a sudden glimpse, through a rift of Time, of the boy she
had known. “All the same,” he protested, “if I <span class='it'>had</span> a horn, I
could learn it in an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, get one,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where can I get one?” he retorted fretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearie! Your tea——!” It was Martha herself now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’d get you one,” said Jinny carelessly, “but I’ll wager
you won’t blow it properly in a week, much less an hour!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A week! What nonsense! In a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a moment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was speaking to mother. What’ll you wager?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pair of gloves,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done!” said Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clucked to Methusalem. “Good-bye,” she called to the
couple as the cart moved off. “I’ll deliver your order next
Friday, Will—without fail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearie, whatever are you running after her for?” cried
Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came back sheepishly: “I thought the gate wasn’t open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the Bradmarsh road the sound of the “fol-de-rol”
refrain came sweetly on the quiet air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish she would sing of Zion,” repeated Martha wistfully.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The pair of polecat ferrets—creamy white albinos, pink of eye
and black of belly—hung in the cages on the back wall of the
farmhouse, with a spare cage beside them as a retiring-place
when a hutch was turned out. But only once—on the Saturday
in the first ardour of possession—had Will taken them out
a-hunting: on which occasion they had refused to rat or rabbit.
Indeed their leaps and gambols persuaded Will that they pursued—as
he remembered the Deacon once maintaining sympathetically
about rats—their “private sports.” Why indeed should sensible
creatures, comfortably fed on chicken-head and blackbirds, and
provided with straw to cocoon themselves against cold, go
squeezing into holes or drains? Restored to captivity, these
fainéant ferrets spent most of their day in squirming with
desperate restlessness from one end of the cage to the other and
perking their quivering noses and little black claws through the
wires. And their master’s own plight was much the same, for
after the prairie, Frog Farm was only a hutch to him: his
father, too, being so unexpectedly on the shelf, there was nothing
that really needed him, nor was there any land for sale in the
vicinity on which he might commence operations. Like his
ferrets, if with a larger run, he swayed restlessly to and fro;
from farm to river, from river to Common, from Common to
Steeples Wood, from Steeples Wood to Frog Farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was not thus oscillating on the landscape, he was
sweating in intellectual indecision in the parlour: trying to write
a little note to Jinny to inform her that she was to come to Frog
Farm no more, inasmuch as he intended to go into Chipstone
himself once or twice a fortnight, and could easily bring home
whatever was necessary. He had thought that when he had
found a feather dropped by a green goose, cut his quill, concocted
an ink out of soot and water, and discovered a piece of white
paper wrapped round his bank-notes, that his difficulties were
over. But the worst now remained, for he could not satisfy
himself as to the phraseology of this note, being, as he had truly
pleaded, no great shakes at letter-writing. Such glibness as he
could muster in conversation was paralysed in fact by a pen.
There was not even one of those word-books he had seen scholarly
people use to ensure the spelling, and one must not unnecessarily
afford material to a minx who—having obviously to do with bills
and accounts—might conceivably be literate. He had a vague
remembrance of her reading texts quite easily at the Sunday-school,
young as she was. Even if she could spell no better
than he, she might possess one of these spelling-protectors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only book at Frog Farm being his mother’s Bible, he tried
to secure accuracy by limiting himself to its words. But its
vocabulary seemed strangely lacking. He had decided, for
example, to begin with “Maddam.” One could not call such a
stranger as the new Jinny “<span class='it'>Dear</span> Miss,” he thought, and “Miss”
alone sounded thin and abrupt. No, “Maddam” was the
mouth-filling resonance necessary: it struck a note of massive
dignity. But did it really have two “d’s”? And to his
amazement and anguish neither “Maddam” nor “Madam”
was to be discovered from Genesis to Revelation. Adam, the
nearest analogue, who came in his reference volume with welcome
promptitude, even precipitateness, had, he found, only one
“d,” but was he a sure guide to the orthography of the creature
formed out of his spare rib? This and the many other curious
and amazing passages that beguiled him on his route—presented
thus to a fresh and world-experienced eye—ran away with so
much time that Martha would be summoning him to the next of
his many meals before he had even dipped his quill into the soot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. William Flynt presents his complements” was another
promising start—he had got a debt-demanding letter once at a
boarding-house with this austerely courteous overture—but
alas!—marvel on marvel—there did not appear to be a single
“complement,” whether in the Old Testament or the New. Not
a very courteous people, the Jews, he thought, under either
dispensation. This happy-go-lucky hunt for words—an exciting
steeplechase in which one skipped over spacious histories and
major prophets with the chance of tumbling on the very word—began
to be an absorbing substitute for ratting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Epistles of James” suddenly caught his eye. Ah, here
was a complete guide to letter-writing, he felt hopefully; what
was good enough for James would do for William. But when
written out, “William, the son of Caleb, of Frog Farm, to Jinny
Quarles of Blackwater Hall, Little Bradmarsh, greeting” did not
seem quite the correct opening. An Epistle of John was, even
more misguiding. “The Elder to the Elect or Well-Beloved!”
Clearly inappropriate to the point of absurdity!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, with modifications, Epistles must surely be valid models.
So he started writing and re-writing, wrestling and hunting and
polishing. But the word-chase had now to be supplemented by
a paper-chase. How keep pace in paper with this orgy of penmanship?
Every corner of the house was ransacked, with
meagre results: he even meditated stealing back his own letter
from his mother, knowing it had a blank fly-sheet, but it was
always jealously guarded. It was not till he came on Farmer
Gale’s boy—schoolward bound—and paid him twopence for the
remains of a penny copy-book that he could surrender himself
freely to the labours of the file. An hour before this large
laying-in of material, he had gone through a curious crisis. He
had found in his purse, in a last desperate quest, a piece of paper
which, unfolded, afforded a welcome white surface. He was
composing quite a successful letter upon it when, on turning it
over, he came upon the address of the forgotten blue-eyed
charmer of the Chelmsford train. With frowning brow he tore
it into small pieces. It was not merely that the letter was
spoilt for sending: it was the juxtaposition with Jinny—back
to back—that seemed suddenly profane.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>After several days’ gestation, many words and turns of expression
having to be rejected and replaced by phrases whose spelling
could be ascertained from the Bible, the letter emerged as
hereunder in a pale and aqueous ink:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“William Flynt to the Damsel of Blackwater Hall greeting.
This epistle doth proclaim in the name of the generations of
Frog Farm that Methuselah shall not come to pass here henceforward,
inasmuch as behold here am I to purchase whatsoever
is verily to be desired from Chipstone, be it candles or oil or
spice or any manner of thing whatsoever, nor shall you carry
forth aught hence, for lo! we will make no further covenant
with you or aught that is yours. Peace be with you, as thank
God it leaves me at present.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“Yours truly,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.25em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>William Flynt</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P.S.—Let not your horn be exalted, nor speak with a stiff
neck, for surely this is not the way to find grace in the eyes of
the discerning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But even this exalted effusion did not survive the first glow of
satisfaction, for although it was treasured up as too good to
destroy, and did not sound unlike the language that the Brothers
and Sisters held in the meeting-house, he could not remember
ever seeing a letter thus couched. It was succeeded by a homelier
version, in which the word “Epistle” stood out as the only
connecting-link. With a composition playing now for safety,
and mainly monosyllabic, it would be a poor diplomacy not to
work in one high-class word, of whose spelling he was sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Epistle is to say,” the new version began abruptly,
“that we don’t need you to call on Frydays——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good heavens! Even Friday was not to be found in the
Bible. Pursuing this astonishing line of investigation, he realized
that Sunday itself was absent from its pages. The Bible without
Sunday! O incredible discoveries of the illuminated!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He altered it, following Genesis, to the “sixth day,” but then
came a paralysing doubt whether it was not the fifth, for how
could you rest on Sunday if that was not the seventh? He
casually remarked to his mother that it was odd they did not
rest on the seventh day, as commanded in Genesis. She explained
to him that Sunday was the Lord’s Day, but he seemed dissatisfied
with the argument. Perhaps Moses &amp; Son were not
so wrong, he remarked, repenting of his resentment against
them for being closed that Saturday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He woke up the next morning with the solution of dodging
the mention of the day and merely relieving Jinny of the duty
of “markiting” for them. He felt sure that this word could
be found, remembering a text about two sparrows being sold
for a farthing. But to his chagrin it was not in the “markit”
that they were sold. In steeplechasing for the word, he tumbled
on a text in Hosea: “Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the
trumpet in Ramah,” and that seemed like an omen. Yes, he
<span class='it'>would</span> blow it in Bradmarsh, if not in Ramah. Let him wait
till she came with the horn; then after whelming her with the
wonder of his execution, he could, face to face and free of orthography,
bid her trouble Frog Farm no more. And the postscript
of his great letter, “Let not your horn be exalted, nor speak
with a stiff neck,” rang through his mind again, like a prophetic
warning against overweening damsels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s come back a new soul,” Martha reported to Caleb, with
shining eyes. “He’s found God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb shook his head sceptically. “He’s too boxed up for
that—he don’t open his heart enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he opens the Bible,” urged Martha, “and he won’t
close it even for meals. I can never get it for myself nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dedn’t you read me as the Devil can spout Scripture?”
said Caleb shrewdly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For shame, Caleb. Anybody can see how changed the boy
is—the only thing that makes me anxious is his Sabbatarian
leanings. Suppose he should go and join the Seventh-Day
Baptists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dip hisself o’ Saturdays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—’tis those that keep Sunday on Saturday. There’s
two in Long Bradmarsh, but I hope Will won’t go straying into
strange paths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You better enlighten him,” said Caleb. “Them as is
powerful enough to carry boxes from Chipstone ain’t allus bright
in the brain-pan. Oi count it ’ud be aukard if he fared to
keep Sunday on Saturday, bein’ as he’d want the Sunday dishes
fust and we’d get ’em cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s higher considerations than the stomach,” said
Martha severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stomach ain’t low and it ain’t high,” maintained Caleb.
“The Lord put the stomach in the middle so as we shouldn’t
neither worship it nor forgit it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only Sunday meal that matters,” persisted Martha,
“is the bread and the wine, and though there’s no Lord’s table
nigh, such as I could find dozens of in London, nor nobody to
worship with except you, yet if you go on scoffing, my duty to
my Brethren and Sisters of the synagogue will be to withdraw
from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where will you goo?” he asked in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t go anywhere—‘withdraw’ only means that it is
forbidden to break bread with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was relieved. “Oi don’t mind so long as you don’t goo
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what will you do in the day of Ezekiel thirty-eight,
when Gog and Magog dash themselves to pieces against Israel?
And when the eighth of Daniel comes to pass, and the Great
Horn is broken and the Little Horn stamps upon the host of
heaven?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi count it won’t be just yet,” he said uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You count wrong. To my reckoning the two thousand three
hundred days of Daniel are nigh up. In the great day of Isaiah
four, when the Tabernacle rises again with the cloud and smoke
and the flaming fire, the people of God shall rise too from their
graves while the others sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you can wake me up, dear heart,” he said, “bein’ as
you’re sure to be up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “<span class='it'>You</span> were always up first, sweetheart,
but that day you’ll sleep on and I’ll have no power to rouse
you—unless, says Isaiah, you ‘look unto me and be saved.’
‘Dust to dust’—that shows we’re not immortal by nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ef it’s comin’ so soon, Oi shan’t be in my grave at all,” he
urged anxiously, “and Oi can push into the Tabernacle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more easy than for wasps to push into the hive. You’ve
seen the bees push ’em back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But one or two does get in and Oi reckon Oi’ll take hold o’
your skirt, same as you been readin’ me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I read you there’ll be ten men to take hold of it,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine other men!” he cried angrily. “But they won’t have
no right to take hold o’ my wife’s skirt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Zechariah says—‘ten men of all languages.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb’s gloom relaxed. “He was thinkin’ o’ Che’msford and
sech-like great places full o’ furriners,” he said decisively. “Here
there’s onny Master Peartree, and the shepherd ain’t a Goloiath.
Oi’ll soon get riddy o’ him, happen he don’t hook hisself to you
with his crook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ll pull in Will too,” said Martha.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But Jinny did not appear on Friday with the musical instrument.
Only the unexpected arrived—in the shape of Bundock.
That royal messenger was visibly hipped as he delivered the
letter to Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman’s writing!” he observed reproachfully. “That
means dragging me here time and again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Will had broken open the high-class adhesive envelope
and was already absorbed in the letter.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—Mr. Quarles thanks Mr. William Flynt for his
esteemed order, but regrets to inform him that a coach-horn of
suitable size for a man is not to be had in Chipstone. They
have not even got a little hunting-horn like mine. I will,
however, superscribe to Chelmsford and get you one without
fail. Trusting for your further patronage,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.25em;'>“Yours truly,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.25em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Daniel Quarles</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N.B.—All orders carried out—or in—with punctuality and
dispatch. Goods sent off without fail to any part of Europe,
America, and Australia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P.S.—Please inform your hond. parents that as she
brought q.f. of groceries that Tuesday I shall not call again till
I deliver your instrument.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>So Jinny had got in first in the pen-fight! And her letter
bowled him over, not only by its bland assumption that she was
already established as his carrier, but by the fluency and scholarship
of its style, with its incomprehensible “superscribe” and
“q.f.” He felt baffled too and even snubbed by the signature,
which gave her a businesslike remoteness, and even a legitimate
status as a mere representative of the masculine, besides making
him feel he had lost a chance by not sending off one of his many
scrawls to the address of this same “Daniel Quarles.” His
answer would now require the profoundest excogitation, he felt,
as he adjusted her missive between the bank-notes and the glove.
There was, moreover, the material problem of vying with this
real and fashionable correspondence paper. Ultimately he became
conscious that Bundock was still standing at attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want anything?” he asked tartly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m waiting for the answer,” said Bundock nobly, “or you
won’t catch a post till to-morrow night unless you trudge to
Long Bradmarsh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there’s no answer—none at all! Thank you all the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank <span class='it'>you</span>!” said Bundock. “It’s not often folks consider
me nowadays—especially when there’s a woman in the case.
They just go on shuttlecocking letters till my feet are sore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it isn’t a woman!” said Will stiffly. “It’s just a
business letter from Gaffer Quarles.” And he pulled it out, and
the little glove fell out with it: which did not lessen his
annoyance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daniel Quarles never put his fist to a pen this ten year,”
asserted Bundock. “He was glad to be done with writing, says
my father, for Daniel was never brought up to be a carrier, his
parents never dreaming he’d inherit the business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not, isn’t he the eldest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The contrairy. Blackwater Hall and the bit of land is one
of those queer properties that go to the youngest, if you die
without a will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The youngest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, and that’s what Daniel was. Borough English, ’tis
called by scholars,” said Bundock impressively. “However, he
picked up a little from his brother Sidrach, who had already set
up as a carrier on his own account round about Harwich, and a
pretty business he did, old Sidrach, says my father, before he
was discovered to be an owler and had to fly to America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were they so persecuted?” murmured Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And didn’t they deserve it—smuggling our good English
wool into France! Pack-horses they loaded with it, the rascals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I thought they were a sect!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock laughed. “That’s with an aitch; though I dare say
many a man owled all the week and howled on Sunday—he,
he, he! Do you know—between you and I—who it is writes
the hymns?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The village idiot!” answered Will smartly. “You told me
so when I was a boy,” he added, seeing the postman’s disconcerted
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock brightened up. “Ah, I thought ’twas too clever for
you. But as for this letter o’ yours, it’s clearly a woman’s
handwriting, and if Jinny once begins writing to her customers,
it’s a bad look-out for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock might well feel a grievance, for this was the first
letter Jinny had ever written to a client, indeed to anybody with
the exception of old Commander Dap, who, clinging to the
friendship struck up at his wife’s funeral, sent her birthday
presents and the gossip of the Watch Vessel. To him she had
written as her heart and her illiteracy prompted, but the elegant
epistle received by Will Flynt was not achieved without considerable
pains. She had the advantage, however, of not being
limited to the Bible for her vocabulary, possessing as she did an
almost modern guide in the shape of an <span class='it'>olla podrida</span> of a Spelling-Book,
whose first edition dated no further back than 1755, the
year of the Lisbon Earthquake. “The Universal Spelling-Book”
had originally belonged to the “owler,” and it was from the
almost limitless resources of this quaint reservoir that, with a
pardonable desire not to be outshone by her much-travelled
neighbour, she culled both the “superscribe” defined as “to
write over” and the q.f. (given in the “List of Abbreviations”
as standing for the Latin of “a sufficient quantity”), except
that she misread the long “s” for an “f.” The immaculate
spelling was, however, no mean feat, for the book’s vocabulary
was very incomplete and devoid of order, so that she had almost
as much steeplechasing to do as her rival letter-writer. Moreover,
she must fain study whole columns of traps for the unwary,
where the terms of her own occupation appeared with disconcerting
frequency. If there was not in the letter any necessity for
distinguishing between “glutinous” and “gluttonous,” “rheum”
and “Rome,” or any risk of confusing a “widow” with a “relic,”
still “seller,” “fare,” “due”—any of which she might have needed—all
had their dangerous doubles, and she did not write “call”
without carefully discriminating it from “Cawl, of a Wig or
Bowels.” “Punctuality and dispatch” was lifted bodily from
Miss Gentry’s billheads, and if she did not offer to send off goods
to Asia and Africa, it was because only “Europe, America, and
Australia” figured on Mr. Flippance’s posters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The recipient of this impressive communication was staggered
by the strides in female education made since his boyhood. He
betook himself at once—to his mother’s joy—to the Bible, like
a Cromwell before a great battle. Martha had stolen the book
back to the kitchen and was pondering texts anxiously when he
wandered in to hunt for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who sent you a letter?” she inquired uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Quarles,” he answered readily. “It’s about an order he
can’t supply, and he asks me to tell you his granddaughter won’t
be coming to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha’s face lit up. “What a pity!” she cried. “She
might have taken my bonnet to Miss Gentry to be re-trimmed.”
Martha had become reconciled to this minor vanity, now it was
strategically unnecessary. “However, your young legs can do
that, dearie, now they’re back, can’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure, mother,” he said, all unconscious of the lapsed
plan. “Why waste money on carriers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed him passionately, but seeing his anxiety to be at
the Bible, she released him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should look at Revelation, one, ten, Willie,” she advised,
“and you’ll understand why the Sabbath——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” he interrupted soothingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Also Colossians, two, sixteen and seventeen—the seventh
day is but a shadow of things to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” he said, escaping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took hours of hard theological study—indeed till Saturday
morning—before the reply to Jinny shaped itself:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—Mr. William Flynt thanks Mr. Daniel Quarles for
his esteemed epistle, and regrets to learn that a coach-horn of
suitable size for a gentelman is not to be had in Chipstone. I
beseech you, however, not to superscribe to Chelmsford as
Methuselah cannot fetch such a compass, and the righteous
man regardeth his beast. Neither do I require a horn at her
hand now or henceforwards.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.25em;'>“Yours truly,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.25em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>William Flynt</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P.S.—Do you think that a maiden of your years aught to
superscribe alone to Chelmsford, a city full of lewdness and
abominations, where men use deceit with their tongues and
the poison of asps is under their lips?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you writing, Will?” said his mother, coming in
to sun herself in his holy studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.” He put his hand over the page of the copy-book,
forgetting she could not read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you writing to Jinny?” she inquired suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—-it’s Daniel,” he corrected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daniel!” she said in amaze. “About the Sabbath?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, about the horn,” he blurted out petulantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Horn!” She was wildly excited. “Is it the Little
Horn or the Great Horn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was amazed. “Well it began with the little horn——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha was radiant. She poured forth her own theory of the
Beast in Daniel, and emboldened by his silent agreement—when
his daze changed into comprehension of her misunderstanding—she
proceeded to elaborate her interpretation of the two thousand
three hundred days of sacrifice. He, meantime, was finally deciding
to turn “Daniel” into “Miss” except in the address.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But Will’s letter could not be posted—for many reasons. He
possessed neither an envelope to vie with Jinny’s, nor one that
was closed with outside devices, nor any sealing-wax to make
his letter its own envelope; he could only fold it into a cocked-hat
and deliver it himself. Apart from these material reasons,
he could not well let Bundock carry an answer, when he had
denied there would be any, and he shrank from conducting his
affairs under that official inquisition: moreover, haste was
imperative if he was to save the girl from that difficult and
dangerous journey, for “superscribe” conveyed to him a sense
of precipitation, and he saw her cart almost stampeding to
Chelmsford. At any moment she might set out in quest of the
Great Horn. That was why he abandoned the idea of toiling to
Chipstone to emulate her refined writing materials. He must
hie to Blackwater Hall that very afternoon and play postman.
He would not, of course, enter the house, but would find a way
of slipping the letter in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The surreptitious deed he meditated gave him almost a
skulking air as he neared the Common, and he shrank from the
observation of all he met, though with the exception of Uncle
Lilliwhyte in a corduroy sleeved waistcoat, driving cows with
a weed-hook, and an old crone who stopped and muttered
with twisted head, he saw only frightened partridges whirring
above or rabbits and field-mice scurrying at his feet. Near
Blackwater Hall he encountered two of Jinny’s milch-goats
tethered, pasturing on the hedgerows, and their bleat had a
cynical ring. The Common itself seemed almost to meet the
sky, for clouds had gathered as suddenly as the crowd by the
Silverlane Pump. He was feeling dispirited as he stole towards
the house, but as he caught sight of the stables and barn at the
rear, it seemed a happy idea to plant his note in some obtrusive
coign. His heart beat like a raw burglar’s as he stood surveying
from afar the primitive sheds whose roofs were thatch, whose
gates palings, whose sides faggots, and in one of which he could
see Methusalem’s head in a trough of oats. The stable-shed
would be the surest place, he thought, or perhaps he could pin
the note on to the harness he saw hanging in an adjoining shed
from nails in the beams. Coming nearer to peer at Methusalem’s
manger, he was startled by the sight of a brown smock-frocked
figure crouched on the littered, dungy floor and belatedly brushing
Methusalem’s fetlocks. Before he could escape he saw the
wizened, snow-bearded, horn-spectacled face turned up at him,
and heard himself recognized in a weakened but unmistakable
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, bless my soul! Ef that bain’t little Willie Flynt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel Quarles rose and straightened himself to his full height,
but nothing in Little Bradmarsh had seemed to Will so pitifully
shrunken. “Little” Willie Flynt indeed towered over the
patriarch who had once seemed Herculean to him. Yet if the
robustiousness that the old carrier had preserved in his eighties
had vanished at last, there was still fire in his eye and a fang or
two in his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope you are well, Mr. Quarles,” said Will, recovering from
the double shock of discovering and being discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t, my lad,” piped the Gaffer. “Did, you’d a
come sooner, seein’ as Time is gettin’ away from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Jin—did your granddaughter tell you I was back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ain’t scarcely told me nawthen else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will’s cheeks burned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ain’t come back improved, says she.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will’s flush grew redder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Oi don’t agree with her—you’ve growed like a prize
marrow. Come into the house and she shall make you a dish
o’ tay—Oi don’t drink it myself, bein’ as Oi promised John
Wesley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you—I’d rather talk where we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Oi can’t inwoite you in here—’tis too mucky.” He
gave Methusalem’s tail a final flick with the brush. “And it’s
blowin’ up for rine. We’ll goo into the barn.” And he led the
way imperiously round by a great and ramifying apple-tree that
hid a little black door secured by a padlock and infinite knots of
string.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One has to be witty,” he commented, patiently undoing the
complications, “with so many thieves about to steal my dole
hay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will had not heard of these thieves, and thought Little
Bradmarsh must be changed indeed, but he waited silently,
wondering what to do with his note. And as he stood thus,
there came from the cottage the sound of a girl’s singing.
Fortunately it was not satirical, so Will could hear it with
pleasure:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always jolly, my little mavis,” said the patriarch,
fumbling on, and, unable to resist the infection, his sepulchral
bass voice took up the Carters’ Chorus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi wouldn’t unlock the barn,” he broke off to explain as the
door swung open, “ef Oi hadn’t such good company.” He stood
peering suspiciously into the tall raftered and beamed glooms;
redolent of old hay and punctuated with a few cobwebbed and
rusty instruments amid the endless litter. Will’s eye was
fascinated by an old wine-barrel flanked by a chaff-cutter and a
turnip-cutter and covered with boards and weights. He divined
it held corn and was thus closed against rats, and a whiff of
aniseed came up in memory, and in a flash he saw the faces of
Tony Flip and the Deacon—and himself flying after a carrier’s
cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve stole my flail,” cried the Gaffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there it is, under that straw,” said Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ay. But there was more logs, Oi’ll goo bail. Drat ’em,
can’t they chop for theirselves? It’ll be that Uncle Lilliwhyte.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but he’s only too honest,” said Will incautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t nobody honest,” barked the Gaffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he sent me an adder——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not he. ’Twas Jinny told him to send the adder. He’d ha’
kept your sixpence and let you whistle for your sarpint. But
next time you want an adder, you come to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you sell ’em too?” he murmured, surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi <span class='it'>be</span> an adder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His spectacles glowed strangely. “Read your Bible, young
man—Dan is an adder in the path, what biteth the horse’s heels,
so that the rider should fall backwards—that’s the blessing of
Jacob—and let no man try to ride roughshod over the likes
o’ me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will shrank back before the passion of his words. Indeed in
that gloomy old barn he began to feel a bit nervous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve brought a note for Jinny,” he said hastily. “Will you
give it to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man took the cocked-hat. “Mr. Daniel Quarles!” he
read slowly. “But it’s for <span class='it'>me</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will’s blush was now papaverous. “No—no!” he stammered.
It was a conjuncture he had not foreseen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire in the old eye leapt up at the contradiction, shot
through the spectacles. “Plain as a pikestaff—Mr. Daniel
Quarles! And then you has the imperence to say there ain’t no
thieves. But ye can’t bamboozle me. Oi could read afore you
could woipe your nose with a muckinger, ay, and my feyther
afore me. Carriers ha’ we been for over a hundred year, and my
big brother Sidrach he had his own pack-horses loaded up with
waluable stuff and writ me a piece ten year ago come haysel,
sayin’ as he hoped Oi should jarney to see him, and please God
Oi will, he gittin’ old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where is he?” asked Will, glad that the Gaffer’s monologue
had drifted from its angry beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Babylon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Babylon?” gasped Will, whose recent theological excursions
had made him almost at home in that purpureal city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my nickname for Che’msford, chuck-full o’ lewdness
and Church-folk. But Oi’ve been meanin’ to goo and look
Sidrach up and hear all about his travels, he bein’ a rare one for
adwentures, but somehow what with my carryin’ work and one
thing and the tother my days fly by—like the Book says—swifter
than a weaver’s shuttle. Happen lucky, though, Oi’ll
git over there to-year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” murmured Will vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No you don’t, drat you!” said the veteran with sudden
viciousness. “Tain’t your care whether Oi ever clap eyes on
my beloved brother agen. A ’nation cowld day it was he had
to goo away—the Brad all ice and they should be tellin’ of the
Che’msford coach as come in without the driver, and he fallen
down on the road, frozen stiff as a sparrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What year was that?” asked Will, to keep the conversation
on this more agreeable level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the year my brother Sidrach went away,” said Daniel
Quarles simply. “ ’Nation cowld. We heerd that in Lunnon
the river was as froze as ourn, and flue-full o’ sports—booths
and turnabouts and pigs roasted whole, and great crowds to see
a young bear baited. But feyther’s cart went to and fro Chipstone
just the same, and brought the news as how a woman was
burned at Newgate for coinin’—it dedn’t seem wery dreadful in
that weather. Waterloo year that was another cowld winter—all
the marsh ditches was solid ice, and all the eels was found
dead and frozen. Couldn’t eat ’em neither, not after the first
day, they stank so. That numb was my fingers Oi could scarce
howld the reins, and you’d ha’ thought by my breath Oi was a
wicked smoker. But ’twas wunnerful times, and we heaped up
a deadly great pile o’ fagots and bushes for the beacon, top o’
yonder rise where ye see Beacon Hill Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the bonfire to celebrate the victory!” said Will, rejoiced
to find irascibility cooled into reminiscence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wictory! That was the name o’ Nelson’s ship as that silly
old Dap should say he sarved in. Nay, this was but a bonfire
to be lit when Bony landed. All along Blackwater we was
ready for the inwasion, and when the beacon was fired, that was
to be the signal. The soldiers was to goo to the coast and the
ciwilians inland. But Bony never come, and ’twas a great
waste. And Sidrach never come neither. ’Nation cowld the
day he went away—Oi moind me gooin’ through a foot o’ snow
across Chipstone poor-piece to the Church to see the Knight
Templar what was dug up in the north aisle, pickled inside three
coffins, but they’d put him back in the outer lead time Oi
arrived. They should say it was a sort o’ mushroom ketchup as
kept him together for the Resurrection Day—a bit blackish, but
wellnigh as sound and good-lookin’ as you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a compliment that made the young man shudder again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, there <span class='it'>is</span> the rain!” he exclaimed, with relief at the hearty
patter on the apple-tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old man would not be fobbed off so enjoyable a topic.
“Three coffins—lead, ellum, and a shell—’twas a witty way agin
them body-snatchers—you ain’t safe agin thieves even in your
tomb. And when you’re above ground they tries to steal your
wery letters.” He pulled open the note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s merely addressed to you as head of the business,” Will
explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, that Oi be, though the youngest. He that is last shall
be fust, says the Book, ay, and the Law too, though ’twasn’t
fair to Sidrach to my thinkin’, bein’ agin nature. And next
time a letter comes for me, do ye don’t bring it and play your
tricks, but let it come natural through Bundock’s grandson.
What’s this? ‘Mr. William Flynt thanks Miss Quarles for her
esteemed epistle.’ And who is Miss Quarles, and what’s she been
writin’ to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About—about business,” said Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t no Miss Quarles in the business,” said the old
man testily. “That be my business, and Oi lets Jinny amuse
herself jauntin’ to and fro, pore gal, she bein’ that lonely on the
Common and afeared o’ dangerous charriters. Rare mistakes,
she makes, bein’ onny a gal, and costs me a pritty penny. But
it ’ud cost me more ef Oi dedn’t stop at home and guard the
house from thieves. And now she wastes more o’ my hard-earned
dubs writin’ to you as is a neighbour—drat the child,
ain’t that got a tongue? ‘A suitable horn?’ Dash my
buttons! What do you be wantin’ with a horn—you bain’t a
guard or a postman, be you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but——!” he stammered. The explanation was not
simple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oi beseech you, however, not to superscroibe to Che’msford’
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘the righteous man regardeth his beast.’ Dang your
imperence! Why shouldn’t Oi goo to Che’msford? Oi ain’t
seen him these sixty year, and do ye don’t come interferin’ ’twixt
brothers. Sidrach writ me a piece ten years agoo come haysel,
arxin’ me to superscroibe to Che’msford, and Oi’ll not be put off
by the likes o’ you. You look here, my lad, ef you’re come
home to meddle or make, the sooner you goos furrin agen, the
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s not you—it’s Miss Quarles I don’t like journeying to
Chelmsford. Look at the P.S.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was imprudent counsel, for, as the Gaffer followed it, his
face became a black cloud, the fire in his eye was lightning, the
odd fangs in his mouth showed like tigers’ tusks, and his beard
seemed like a tempestuous besom sweeping all before it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Lewdness and abominations.’ You call my Jinny a
Jezebel! Git out o’ my house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m only in your barn,” Will reminded him, “and it’s
raining, and you just said yourself that Chelmsford is a Babylon
chock-full of abominations. And you’d let a young girl superscribe
there all alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny shall superscroibe where she pleases!” roared the
Gaffer. “For over a hundred year the Quarleses have superscroibed
in foul weather or foine, with none to say ’em nay, and
it ain’t for a looker’s son to come here dictatin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t dictate,” said Will, with a fleeting schoolboy memory.
“I wrote it with my own hand. Look here, Mr. Quarles,” he
went on, trying another tack, “you’re a sensible old gent with
great experience of the world, and it makes me frightened to see
that grandchild of yours gadding about so far from home, and
sometimes not getting back here till dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t timorsome—onny when she’s alone here,” he
added cunningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe, but with such a pretty girl——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, she’s like a little bird with her little fitten—and allus
singin’ like one too—all the day that goos about singin’, ‘Fol
de rol——’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” said Will, wincing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Oi’d best tear up your letter—she don’t want to read
about lewdness and abomination except in the Howly Book. And
Oi count she has enough o’ that on Sunday with you Peculiars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is better she should read about it than scutter about seeing
it. A cart ain’t a suitable place for a girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cart’s as suitable for Jinny as a horn for you,” retorted
the old man, bridling up again. “Oi suspicion you’re plottin’ to
steal her away from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” Will’s cheeks burned with indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Oi count you’ve got your eye on the cart too, like you
bolted off to Harwich with your feyther’s wagon. There won’t
be naught left for me but the poorhouse. But Oi’d die sooner.”
He was almost blubbering now with self-pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi saved a mort o’ money once,” he said, “though it took a
deadly time scrapin’ the dubs together, what with the expense o’
dinner at “The Black Sheep” and the hoss’s feed—fower parcels
or fowerty, Oi never stinted him o’ his peck o’ chaff, and three
and a half pound o’ oats and the same o’ ground beans, and
there’s folks as grumble to pay accordin’ to the soize and compass
o’ the parcel, though there’s nights your hoss goos so lame and
you’re that pierced with wind and snow you got to knock up a
farm and borry a hoss to git home with, and them days it was
the barges took away custom. Old Bidlake used to goo along
canals and cricks as ain’t there no longer, thank the Lord, bein’
as they sea-walls have made a many willages high and droy.
But Oi had to pay all my savin’s away to keep our name from
disgrace, so as Emma should howd up her head in Kingdom Come.
He hadn’t the bed he died in, for all his traipsin’ around in
<span class='it'>Tommy Devils</span>; but time Oi went down to git Jinny, Oi made
inquirations among the tradespeople and paid ’em to the last
farden, aldoe soon as my back was turned, my own sister plots
with her one-eyed little ship’s monkey to pay for a stone, as ef
Oi’d neglected my own darter, and all spiled with wicked words—did
you ever see such words in a Christian churchyard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not,” soothingly murmured Will, to whom the
long rigmarole conveyed nothing except: a sense of pathetic and
loquacious senility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” said the Gaffer with satisfaction. “Oi says to Dap,
says Oi, ‘A Churchman like you may not see the blarsphemy, but
think what John Wesley would ha’ said to it.’ ‘Sir,’ Oi says to
the old gentleman, ‘you jump into my cart,’ says Oi, ‘and not
a sowl here shall harm a hair o’ your wig’; and with that Oi
wheeled round my whip, and bein’ then an able-bodied young
man (’twas the wery fust year arter feyther died), them as was
throwin’ stones and cryin’ ‘Knock his brines out’ slunk away
like blackbeadles, which was a pity, seein’ as they missed the
be-yutiful words he preached from my cart. From Chipstone to
Che’msford Oi carried him—a dogged piece out o’ my way, bein’
as he wanted to preach there and his own hoss had gone lame—’twas
the wile o’ that great old murderer, Satan, says he, but
the Almoighty sent you to confound his knavish tricks. That
was a man of God, my lad, never out of heart, roighteous and
bold as a lion, would preach even in front of a gin-shop where
’twas writ up: ‘Drunk a penny, dead-drunk twopence, clean
straw for nawthen.’ Pounded glass mixed with mud the sons
of Bellal threw in his face, but his eye-soight was not dimmed,
nor his nat’ral force abated. Used to preach as much as foive
times a day, gittin’ up at fower o’ the clock, and travellin’ a
bigger round than me, but wunnerful healthy, slept like a baby
in my cart, and that saintly he said all his life he’d never done
naught as ’ud bear lookin’ at. He made me sing a hume with
him and we was singin’ it as we come into Babylon:</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the sepulchral bass quavered out the tune, Jinny’s fresh
voice could be heard from the back door calling “Gran’fer!
Gran’fer! Where <span class='it'>are</span> you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thinks Oi’m out in the rine,” chuckled the old man, “but
let her come and find me. His blessin’ he gave me at partin’,
did John Wesley, and do ye don’t never smoke nor drink that
pison stuff, tay, says he. ‘Oi’ll promise ye tay and gin too,’ says
Oi, bein’ as Oi liked beer best. ‘But to give up baccy, that’s
main hard,’ Oi says. ‘There’s harder,’ says he, lightning-like.
‘Promise me as ye won’t be friends with a woman as is younger
than your wife, for there’s unhowly sperrits about,’ says he, ‘as
brings gales and earthquakes and tempitations, and the best o’
men may git capsoized same as the <span class='it'>Royal George</span>, our best ship,
t’other year.’ Lord, that fair capsoized me, for how could this
furrin ole gen’leman in his eighties know about Annie, as wasn’t
seventeen yet for all her wunnerful fine buzzom, and the missus
older than me, in looks Oi mean, bein’ as she was two years
younger the fust time that worritin’ census paper come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be the year Oi put new thatch on this wery
barn for the new century.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what year did you meet John Wesley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’d best git Jinny to work that out. But it couldn’t be
many year afore the Jew Mendoza boxed Dick Humphreys for
the Championship, for Oi wouldn’t goo, ne yet bet on it, bein’ as
my sowl was saved, and when Oi lifted up my woice at the
camp-meetin’s and chapels in praise and repentance and shouted
‘Glory! Glory!’ dancin’-like, with the tears for my sins
runnin’ down my cheeks, that was more joy to me than Annie
and the prize-ring and cock-foightin’ rolled into one. And Oi
ain’t never backslided, praise the Lord, bein’ as Annie married a
sedan-chair man and was hiked away to Cowchester, and Oi hope
for your immortal sowl’s sake, my lad, you bain’t like what Oi
was at your age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” said Will, not without uneasiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The patriarch shook his head. “There’s the old Adam in you,
plain to discern. Ye won’t be safe till ye’re married. But do
ye don’t marry an old gander of a widow like that potboy they
should be tellin’ of,”—he began to cackle—“that’ll onny lead to
wuss mischief. Wait till you happen on a clean little lass, rosy
and untapped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A girl like your granddaughter, you mean?” Will heard
himself saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cackle ceased abruptly and the grin was replaced by a
glare. “That ain’t gooin’ to be married! That’s got to goo
out with my cart, whenever Oi’m too busy workin’. Ef a rich
man like Farmer Gale as drives her to chapel Sundays should be
wantin’ her all the week, Oi don’t say Oi wouldn’t goo with her
to the big house, but that ain’t likely, and she can’t have nawthen
to say to a rollin’ stone as mebbe left a pack o’ wives among
they Mormons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was nettled. “And who asked for your granddaughter?”
he retorted. “Besides, you’re quite right. I married dozens of
wives in America—all widows too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The veteran chuckled afresh. “Dash my buttons! How you
do mind me o’ your feyther when he was your age—always had
his little joke. Not that Oi count him growed up yet, he havin’
never cut his wisdom teeth, but gooin’ off as skittish as a colt
arter peculiar doctrines and seducin’ sperrits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there you are, Gran’fer!” And pat as to a cue a most
“seducin’ sperrit” flashed, like a shaft of sunshine, through
the half-open door into the gloomy old barn. But she was
aproned and bare-armed to the elbow, and rain-spotted, and a
ringlet of hair was blown almost across her mouth, and the
instant she perceived Will, she drew back in confusion, patting
her hair tidy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, Gran’fer. I didn’t know you had visitors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Will, to whom the sense she conveyed of brooms and
dusters was sweetly reassuring of a still unsubmerged femininity,
cried out as hastily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I was just going. You’ll get drowned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he tried to pass her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old man dramatically extended the uncocked hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Howd hard, sonny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will, disconcerted, found his feet sticking to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s writ me a letter, imperent little Willie, and brought it
hisself.” Then a flash of amusement toned down the asperity.
“Aldoe he had his tongue with him!” And the old man
chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I read it?” murmured Jinny, putting forth her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay!” He snatched the note back and tore it into
careful pieces. “Ain’t fit to be seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more am I,” said Jinny with an uneasy laugh, and again
she essayed to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” commanded the ancient, kindled afresh. “Willie’s
got to tell you what’s in they scraps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t stand gawmin’. Out with the abomination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no sound issued from the young man’s lips. It was not
merely that this new housemaidenly figure seemed safe enough
even in Chelmsford, wrapped in its own sweet domesticity, and
that adjurations designed for the minx bade fair to blunt themselves
against this sober angelhood; but that the girl’s radiance
against the littered gloom within and the rainfall without, robbed
him literally of breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak out, Willie!” said the Gaffer, softened to contempt
by his obvious confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he <span class='it'>hasn’t</span> brought his tongue,” suggested Jinny,
recovering herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Oi’ll lend him mine. You ain’t to goo to Che’msford,
he says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t want to go to Chelmsford, Gran’fer. Why
should I go to Chelmsford?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To get his horn, you baggage. And he don’t be wantin’ it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but he ordered it—it’s too late now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay,” said Daniel Quarles, “and goo you shall to git it ef
the adder has to bite Methusalem’s heels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t have to go to Chelmsford for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said you’d go to Chelmsford,” burst out Will at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of the sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve got your letter!” He pulled it out, and again
that awkward glove fell out. “Ah, there’s your glove I’ve
found on the road,” he said, crimsoning furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you!” She took both letter and glove placidly.
“Now I shall have two pairs! But where do I say anything
about going to Chelmsford?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus invited, he came and looked down at the paper she held,
and gripped an end of it himself, very conscious of her near
fingers, and her bared arm, and her bending head. He was
about to cry: “Why, there!” when a horrible doubt lest “superscribe”
did not mean dashing away, or stampeding, or scurrying,
or driving, or even going, checked the exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must ha’ misread it,” he said. “I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spoken like a Christian!” said the Gaffer. “And Oi count
John Wesley ’ud a said let bygones be bygones. Sow bring out
the beer, Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you—I’m afraid I can’t stay,” said Will. He had a
sullen sense of defeat, which the loss of the glove seemed to
accentuate and symbolize. “My folks’ll expect me home to
tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Mormon wives? Ay, Jinny, you may well blush,”
the Gaffer chuckled. “Willie’s been and married a pack o’
widows in America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And left them there!” said Will, permitting himself a faint
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Left all those widows!” laughed Jinny. “How deadly dead
you must be!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But despite the merriment in which the episode had so unexpectedly
ended, and despite the rain which had now grown
torrential, he tore himself obstinately away, even refusing the
“umberella” which the old man suggested and Jinny offered
to fetch; though as he stepped under the plashing apple-boughs,
he felt himself doubly foolish to refuse what would have been a
literal handle for a return visit. And now that he had caught
a glimpse of what he told himself was the real Jinny, not the
Tuesday and Friday swashbuckler, but the Saturday-cleaning-up-for-Sunday
house-angel, he did not despair of inducing her to
shed these husks of bravado. But he had said “no,” and “no”
to his great annoyance it must be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you propose to superscribe?” he asked with crafty
lightness, as he raised his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I <span class='it'>have</span> superscribed,” said Jinny. “But of course
if it doesn’t come soon, I shall write over to Chelmsford again.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The first Sunday of Will’s home-coming, nothing had been said
about chapel. That, his elders thought, might be still a sore
subject with the boy whose resentment at sacrificing his buttons
on the altar had driven him “furrin.” Still more delicate was
the theological position into which the couple themselves had
gradually drifted, and of which they now—before a spectator
and critic—grew uneasily conscious. Martha’s Ecclesia in Long
Bradmarsh having collapsed almost as soon as she had been
converted to it, she had no meeting-house to go to, and, almost
simultaneously, Caleb, whose farm-wagons had recently been
shifted to the new “looker’s” headquarters, ceased to attend
his Chipstone Chapel. This was partly to keep his wife company
of a Sunday, partly because so many miles there and back was
getting too much for his legs. In consequence the pair had
arrived by compromise at a Sunday ritual of their own, a sort of
Peculiar Christadelphianism, and Uncle Lilliwhyte, who never
entered any of the many houses of God—it was popularly
supposed he would not or could not remove his gay-stringed
beaver—would often loiter outside Frog Farm in Church hours,
listening to their loudly trolled and hybrid hymnology in a sort
of pious eavesdropping. That was Uncle Lilliwhyte’s individual
contribution to the chaos of creeds that reigned in Bradmarsh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even this minimum of religion was denied the honest snake-seller
when Will returned. The first Sunday, Caleb and Martha
held their services furtively in their hermetically sealed bedroom,
hardly daring to hum what they had so lustily intoned: by a
common instinct they shrank from obtruding their departure
from that straitness of doctrine in which Will had been reared.
They were indeed secretly relieved that he made no reference to
religion, nor seemed to expect them to go to the old chapel, nor
even noted the Sundayness of the dishes that Martha served
up with the same careful everyday air with which Caleb consumed
them. They were equally relieved, however, that he
did not go out rabbiting on the holy day with his new pet
ferrets. “Oi’ve known some as dedn’t consider that work,”
said Caleb, as they discussed this dread possibility. “But to
my thinkin’, if ye goo out with a spade, ye might as well be
ploughin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was what they said in bed on the first Saturday night.
Very different was their conversation on the eve of the next
Sunday. The problems all came now from Will’s over-interest
in religion. True, the Sabbatarian peril had not yet materialized:
he had neither worn his best clothes on the Saturday nor demanded
priority in the Sabbath dishes. But he had dropped
more than one perturbing remark. Old Quarles, he supposed,
was now too old to worship at his Wesleyan Chapel in Long
Bradmarsh, to which Caleb had replied naïvely: “Ay, he sleeps
at home Sunday mornings.” Presumably, then, Jinny would not
leave the old man alone on Sunday as well as on Tuesday and
Friday: to which Caleb had answered cautiously—and without
admitting that his observations were not up to date—that
doubtless Jinny could only worship occasionally with the Peculiars
and it depended on her getting a lift, Methusalem being a strict
Sunday observer. Yes, he <span class='it'>had</span> heard Farmer Gale sometimes
gave her a lift—who had told Willie? he wondered—but he
supposed it was because the farmer, like her grandfather, was a
Wesleyan. Later, Will had remarked casually to his mother
that he didn’t suppose Miss Quarles would be able to get to
chapel on the morrow, as he had happened on her old grandfather,
who seemed quite breaking up. Martha, murmuring
sympathetically that Mr. Quarles must be getting old, was likewise
compelled to gloss over her inacquaintance with Jinny’s
latest Sunday habits: she shocked and surprised herself by
remarking that one’s grandfather would hardly count against
Farmer Gale, and hastened to add—especially as Will seemed
shocked too—that such was Jinny’s devotion to her grandfather
that not for some years had she been able to stay longer than the
Morning Service. Rejoiced though the old woman was at Will’s
mingled concern for the religion of the young and the weal of
the old, she was a little uneasy at this personal turn of his theological
thinking, and she quickly changed the conversation to
the Great Horn and the Beast, a discussion which in her eagerness
she hardly noticed was practically a monologue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By nightfall that Saturday Caleb had gathered, with a sinking
of the heart, that Will designed to accompany his elders on the
morrow—and to Early Service! The boy had apparently failed
to remark the breach in the old chapel routine the previous
Sabbath: the Sunday had been hushed up only too successfully.
It was as far as Caleb dared go, in the first plunge of confession, to
say that, in the absence of a vehicle, Early Service at Chipstone
was out of the question nowadays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the situation that faced the old couple in the sleepless
watches of the second Saturday night, and dimmed even Martha’s
joy in the prodigal’s return to religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Best go with him, like when he was little,” she decided. “We
mustn’t unsettle him so soon, now he’s found God again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t so sure he’s found God,” said Caleb shrewdly. “God
ain’t in a goose-quill, and writin’ a piece about Daniel ain’t the
road to heaven, else where would me and most o’ the Brethren
be? To my thinkin’ Will’s onny lost the Devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the same thing. What else does he want to go to
chapel for, and Early Service at that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To make trouble,” said Caleb fretfully. “We was all so
happy till he come—and you had Maria.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Caleb, you don’t deserve the Lord should give him back
to you! And if you don’t go to-morrow, I’ll withdraw from
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t right,” said poor Caleb, puzzled by the unscrupulous
threat. “But ef it’s onny for Morning Sarvice he’ll expect
you to goo too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows about my rheumatics, dear heart,” she said
casuistically. “He knows I couldn’t walk even to get my
bonnet cleaned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ef you were to tell him about the New Jerusalem——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d best find that himself, now he’s on the way. It’s not
far from Daniel.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it was that Uncle Lilliwhyte was again defrauded of his
ritual and that after a still more furtive and still earlier service
in the sanctity of their airless bedroom, with hymns muted and
prayers guiltily whispered, the couple appeared at an eight
o’clock breakfast with an air of devotions unpaid, and Caleb,
hurrying the meal, remarked that ’twas time to get ready for
chapel or they would miss even the Morning Service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this, Will, who was in his fashionable London jacket—to
the admiring awe of his elders—sprang up, and rushing to the
back of the house near the water-barrel, brushed away hastily
at a dull speck on his boot where a spurt from the boiling kettle
had blotted out the shine he had so laboriously imparted. The
male ferret, caged just above his stooping head, awoke at the
agitation, and started rubbing itself under the neck as if in
parody, but far more swiftly and persistently; then it jerked
its nose and its thin whiskers through the wires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to-day,” laughed Will, jabbing its nose with the blacking-brush.
He felt very gentlemanly and happy, for the brief rain
of the evening before had dried up, and the day was as fine as
his clothes. As Caleb came out in quest of Will, the ferret was
just snuggling back to slumber, and the old man, yawning with
the loss of his Sunday morning sleep, looked enviously at the
creature coiling itself so voluptuously in its straw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky Jinny brought me sech a noice Sunday neckercher,”
he said, “or Oi’d ha’ been ashamed to walk with ye. Ye look
like our Member o’ Parlyment.” He himself looked, however, a
respectable figure enough in his tall hat and finely stitched and
patterned Sunday smock, his high-lows and gaiters, and it was
not till they were getting over the stile that led to the short cut
through the Green Lane that Will observed that his senior
carried, like a tramp, a bundle in his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” he inquired fretfully, becoming aware too
that the Green Lane, even at its best, offered perils to his boot-polish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my hume-book and our dinner and tea. There’s two
packets for each on us, and we must be home for supper. Don’t,
your poor mother will be lonely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will had forgotten these meals: they had, in his boyhood,
been carried decorously in the wagon. But the sunshine of the
mid-May morning did not permit ill-humours, and they strode
happily along the dappled by-ways, bounding over the shrunken
sloughs, the son uplifted even beyond boot-polish by the intoxication
of the Spring, and the father by the intoxication of the
Spirit. For, the moment Caleb had crossed the stile, the old
rapture of fellow-worship had returned, and the absence of
Martha seemed to lift the shadow of her criticism; while doubts
of his son’s regeneration could hardly survive the sight of his
springy step chapelwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was indeed living over again his childish memories of
these Sunday journeys, and, somewhat to his surprise, something
fresh and delicious seemed to emanate from them. It had after
all been a pleasant change in the weekly round, this family jaunt
with the big double-lidded provision basket, while the congregational
picnicking in the chapel had not been without its jollity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Caleb did not leave him long to his memories. The old
Peculiar was anxious to have a problem solved that had been
weighing upon him these two years. In the New Jerusalem,
whose descent to earth—ready-made and complete—was, according
to Martha, imminent, to the impending confusion of disbelievers,
there was to be “A street of pure gold, as it were
transparent glass.” Martha—as if to immunize him against his
visit to the old Peculiar Meeting-house—had read out the text
that very morning at their surreptitious service. And his ear
had always heard “brass” instead of “glass.” But how could
gold be brass or either transparent? He did not like to shock
her by questioning the letter of a text—his differences from her
turned merely on the relative importance and significance of
her texts as compared with those he had picked up from the
Peculiars. Yet this puzzle was perhaps what really prevented
him making the final plunge into Christadelphianism. It is
true he might have demanded her solution of it—often through
those long months of controversy as he looked at her saintly face
so quiet on the pillow beside him, it was borne in upon him that
in that bookish brain, under that frilled cotton nightcap, lay the
explanation of the holy mystery. But possibly, with the subterranean
obstinacy of the peasant, he shrank from an elucidation
which might have left him irremediably at her mercy. A vindication
of the text by Will, on the other hand, would give him time to
turn round, take his new bearings. And a young man who was
capable of composing a thesis upon the Little Horn and the
Great Horn, could surely wrestle with this mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi hear you writ a piece about Daniel,” he began tactfully, as
they crossed the bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will frowned. He had forgotten Martha’s misunderstanding.
“Has he been round telling you?” he asked angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me!” Caleb stared. “Oi bain’t howly enough for wisions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was puzzled in his turn. “You mean he can’t walk so far!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi wouldn’t say that: happen he can fly if he wants to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely! A man so howly in his life—him what——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dead! So suddenly! Will stood still. This altered many
things. The winged image of the Gaffer faded before the picture
of a lonely Jinny. “When did he die?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that better than me,” said Caleb meekly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the thought that his “epistle” had over-excited the
patriarch and stilled that aged heart, shot up, agitating the young
man. That was why relief mingled with a vague disappointment
when Caleb went on: “They lions couldn’t kill him, but Oi
reckon he had to die some time. But many of them what sleep
in the dust of the earth shall awake, he tells us, and maybe”—he
added with a flash—“they’ll wake up in that golden city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will grunted a vague “Maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Touching that there city,” said Caleb, “the gold of the street
thereof will be transparent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” murmured Will, suppressing a yawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew! And the contradiction did not strike him! Instantly,
as by another flash, the text solved itself in the old
man’s mind—gold in those millennial days, while it retained its
sacred splendour would also lose its gross opaqueness, becoming
rarefied, disembodied, spiritualized, so that gold was as brass
since both were like glass, making thus a harmony of light with
the jasper wall, clear as crystal, and the twelve giant pearls of
the gates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be a pritty sight!” he mused aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, like the Crystal Palace,” sneered Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seen that?” asked Caleb eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man couldn’t be in London and escape seeing it,” said
Will. “Every cad drags you into his omnibus bound for Hyde
Park. Such a crowd!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the chimney-sweep got his pocket picked, Bundock’s
buoy-oy was a-tellin’,” said Caleb, “but the streets thereof, be
they of gold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The streets of London?” said Will, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noa, the streets of the Crystal City?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they can’t be brass neither?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More like grass,” Will laughed. “For there’s real trees left
standing inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb joined in the boy’s laugh. Though he had never really
believed that the Crystal Palace represented the Millennial City,
it was well to have the danger finally cleared away. And,
abandoning the gold-brass puzzle, his mind flew back illogically
but passionately to his Peculiar Brethren and the joy of the
awaiting ritual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, here’s Plashy Hall!” said Will. “And the dog seems
having his Sunday nap.” He threw open the white gate marked
“No thoroughfare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s closed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Closed!” said Will in fiery accents. “I shan’t even close
it after us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I count they won’t mind <span class='it'>you</span> in your Parlyment coat,
but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go along, dad.” And Will pushed the old man into Plashy
Walk and strode forward like a village Hampden. Within a
minute he missed Caleb, and looking back, saw him hurrying
back from the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must allus shut ga-aites!” he apologized with his rising
accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll burn it next time,” said Will. “Why, this saves us a
mile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’ll miss the Early Sarvicers,” complained Caleb.
“You’ve forgot how they walk out to meet the Brethren, what
come footin’ it from afar, and have an extry sarvice at a half-way
house back o’ Long Bradmarsh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely the regular services will be enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ’tis noice to git an extry snack,” said Caleb wistfully.
“Many’s the Sunday Oi’ve had foive sarvices.” He sighed
voluptuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, better luck next time,” said Will lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tone was not unkindly, but Caleb took it in full earnest,
and his long secret grievance against Martha began to ooze into
speech under the spell of his son’s sympathy. Her warning against
unsettling the boy was forgotten in this natural gravitation of
male to male against female fantasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “I’ve allus been fast and faithful all along.
’Tis mother that’s allus gooin’ forrard. And woundily wilful—Oi
never met nobody loike her, barrin’ old Quarles. When we
married we was both Sprinklers, but scarcely had we got six
childer afore she says she must be baptoized. Wait till the
summer, says Oi, for ’twas a black Feb’ary. But no—sow
headlong is her natur’ they had to break the ice. She give a
deep soigh when the water took her—it a’most unhinged me.
But she would have it she felt sow happy and contented. She
drilled me hard to make me take the total immersion too—’nation
obstinate is mother, but Oi’ve allus stood out stubborn
for the Truth. Fast and faithful,” he repeated, as if to reassure
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but you changed too!” Will reminded him less kindly.
“You weren’t born a Faith-Healer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t my fault, bein’ as the truth wasn’t found out in
my young days, though they warses o’ Jeames was there all the
time. But the fust day Oi met the Brethren Oi knowed they
were the people for me. There was one on ’em among my own
labourers. When Oi said as we didn’t know ’zactly what God
was, he said, says he: ‘God’s like you and me, bein’ as He made
man in His own image.’ That was an eye-opener to me. But
the others parsecuted him and called him Brother Jerusalem as
a rewoilin’ word. He had a fork to pitch a high load—cost
foive shillin’s, fancy what a good fork that must ha’ been—and
they went and broke it. Oi was grieved, but naught grieved
him except to grieve the Lord. He dedn’t drink neither, and
you look so odd if you don’t drink. But when they wanted to
stand treat, he said he’d take bread and cheese. ‘Goo to hell,’
says they. ‘There ain’t no hell, even for you,’ he answers soft;
‘you’ll be in the same darkness as now, that’s all.’ That was
another eye-opener. Oi was taken with that hell—not bright
and burnin’, but all black and cowld—so Oi came out o’ my
darkness and jined the Brethren, and gave up beer, barrin’
harvest-time, which rejoiced mother and was money saved for
the childer. Be-yu-tiful things were brought to pass and be-yu-tiful
things were said the day Oi went to my fust sarvice,
and ef the Lord is with you to-day when you speak o’ your
experiences, Oi count be-yu-tiful things will be brought out
agen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will shuddered. He stopped abruptly and was nigh turning
back. He had forgotten that the Brethren would expect his
soul-experiences and confessions—especially after this spacious
and adventurous interval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s-a-matter?” asked Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, nothing,” he said, remembering his own power of
sullen silence. And to say something, he asked, as he walked
on: “And what’s wrong with mother now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wrong?” Caleb was shocked at this crude interpretation.
“Oi don’t be meanin’ she ain’t in her rights to hunt out new
texts, she bein’ a scholard. There was allus a bran-span-new
one, Oi mind me, the Sundays I used to goo a-courtin’ her. A
wery long way she lived—they talk broad and careless where
she comes from, not moist and proper like here—and Oi had to
git up early and goo along the sea-wall—deadly dark and lonesome
it was winter nights and mornin’s, but her face was allus
with me like the moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, was she pretty then?” asked Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see?” replied Caleb, with a faint surprise. “She
ain’t changed much, she havin’ allus the peace of God in her
heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was touched and astonished by this revelation of romance
in the two elderly people foisted upon him as parents, whom he
had all his life taken as eternally elderly. But still more surprising
was the realization forced upon him that the religion which
to him was a bore was to them a thrill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I carry the parcel, father?” he asked gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay, that don’t goo with Parlyment clothes. And it
ain’t as sizeable as the box you carried from Chipstone.” He
chuckled in freshly admiring glee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing adown the long hawthorn avenue, they now issued
from Plashy Walk, the rights of leg vindicated, and soon they
began to see signs of other pilgrims faring towards Chipstone,
that great gathering-place of faiths and creeds.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> old England has always been rich in “characters,” in those
grotesque or gnarled individualities that have escaped the
common mould, the superabundance of sects, which, in conjunction
with the paucity of sauces, amused Voltaire, has its natural
explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Bull—himself a “character” among nationalities—could
not long endure the Papal leading-strings, and ever since the
days of Wycliffe a succession of free spirits has founded
“heresies,” not a few based on misunderstood mistranslations of
Greek or Hebrew texts, torn from their literary and, above all,
their historical context. But why during these five centuries
Essex has been a breeding-place for Nonconformity, second to
no other county, is a problem to tempt the philosopher. For its
ministers have been silenced or ejected in numbers almost unparalleled;
some indeed merely for tippling, dicing, carding, and
womanizing, but the majority for the more serious offences of
heresy or disrespect towards Parliament; while simple peasants—men,
women, and girls—for their participation in seditious
conventicles or practices, have been fined, jailed, transported to
“His Majesty’s plantations,” and even nailed to stakes and
burnt alive, clapping their hands the while with joy. Some of
the most moving scenes of “Foxe’s Book of Martyrs” and
Bloomfield’s “History of the Martyrs” are laid in Essex.
Triumphant descendants of these opinionated saints were now
converging on Chipstone from every quarter of the compass—it
was but a toy-model of a town, yet it held in its petty periphery
chapels, meeting-houses, or churches—ancient-towered or drably
wooden or offering the image of a tinned congregation, tightly
packed—for Baptists (Particular or General), Quakers, Wesleyans,
Congregationalists, Peculiars, and Primitive Methodists,
as well as your everyday Churchgoer; nothing indeed was
wanting except an Ecclesia for the variation represented by
Martha. And as most of these structures were in the High
Street, or just off it, you beheld in that ancient thoroughfare of
a Sunday a crowd of Christians, as like to the naked eye as a
flock of sheep, sorting themselves into their denominational
pigeon-holes, and disappearing as suddenly to right or left as
the pedestrians in “The Vision of Mirza” vanished downwards
through the trap-doors in the bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all these types of Christian none seemed so indigenous to
Essex as that aptly christened “Peculiar”: it was as though
peculiar to the marshes, an emanation of the soil. Though the
first apostolic fervour was over in Chipstone, and the spirit was
moving rather towards Woodham and Southend, the sect was
still young and persecuted enough to be a devoted brotherhood,
as Will soon realized from the greetings which his father exchanged
with fellow-pilgrims, who grew more and more frequent as they
drew nigh the outskirts of the theological town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, among others, a cheerful-looking woman pushing a
four-wheeled baby-cart, which held an infant back and front, and
a food-parcel sandwiched between them. Caleb, addressing her
as Sister, offered to wheel it, but she replied that the children
would cry at a stranger. “Well, you’ll soon be comin’ to your
destiny,” said Caleb. But before Will and he had forged ahead
of her, she had begun pouring out a premature confession. Two
or three were gathered together, and the Spirit seemingly blew
through her. That time last year she hadn’t trusted the Lord:
when they were wheeling the cart to chapel, she had wondered
to her husband how she could fit in the coming baby. And the
Lord had now made room by taking the prior baby, so that
she was well chastised: moreover they had “parsecuted” her
husband before a magistrate for not calling in a doctor for the
child, but as it wasn’t insured, they had only put him in prison
for a little. All the same he was “broke up,” having always
been a “forthright” man. The Lord was indeed trying him
by fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ’twas the same, Willie, when your brother what’s-a-name
died,” said Caleb as they drew ahead of the labouring baby-cart.
“But the Brethren now exhort one another not to insure their
childer, Satan being swift to cry child-murder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>isn’t</span> it child-murder if a doctor might have saved it?”
asked Will coldly, for the woman’s story had shocked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb looked pained. “Ef the Lord wouldn’t listen even to
prayers, is it likely He’d regard doctors? Howsomever the
Brethren stand fast and faithful—they goo to prison even at
harvest-time when you’re worth forever o’ money. But the
Lord’s people are wunnerful good to one another, and the Elders
look arter the families. Oh, what a joyous Harvest Thanksgivin’
we had two years agoo, time the martyrs came out o’ their cells.
All in the open air it was, and Deacon Mawhood brought out
be-yu-tiful lessons. No matter you lost your harvest money, he
says, you won the palm and the crown, and ’tis the Second
Harvest in the heavenly fields with angels to squinch your thirst
from golden wessels that shall be yourn, says the Deacon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will received the rat-catcher’s rhetoric with a snort, which put
Caleb again on the defensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ve never took no medicine for ten year,” said Caleb.
“And look at me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve taken plenty,” said Will. “And look at me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi allow Oi ain’t a Samson like you,” admitted Caleb
honestly, “nor couldn’t carry a box that far. And when Oi say
no medicine, Oi don’t mean when Oi’m not ill. For same as
Oi’m well, mother makes me take a little pill afore meals, bein’ a
wegeble as stops the gripes. There ain’t naught about that in
the Bible, seein’ as the text starts onny when you git sick. And
arter she lost your brother Jim—or maybe he was Zecharoiah—she
did fetch a doctor for the tothers, argufyin’ that when
the child’s too young to seek grace of itself, oil inside ain’t no
wuss than oil outside. And then they Christy Dolphins come
along——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are they?” inquired Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Caleb drew up with a sudden remembrance. “You’ll
find that out for yourself. They ain’t far from Daniel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Live on the Common, do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noa—there ain’t none near us—there was two in Long
Bradmarsh, but they’ve gone back to the Joanna prophet
woman, so your poor mother ain’t got—” he broke off again.
“Oi don’t say ef mother was took real bad, Oi shouldn’t goo and
git Doctor Gory, seein’ as she threatens to goo for him same as
Oi’m ill. It ain’t the doctor, it’s the faith, says mother, and so
long as you don’t believe in the doctor, there ain’t no harm in
lettin’ him thump you about. So long as your heart turns to
God, says mother, the doctor can listen to it all he likes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you do have the doctor!” Will was amused at these
compromises exacted by his masterful mother, whose heretical
evolution after the loss of offspring he could, however, well
understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noa—noa, not for us—leastways not yet,” Caleb protested.
“That was onny for the childer. That made us feel free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Free?” Will queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not responsible like.” He was somewhat embarrassed.
“Faith-healin’ ain’t the main thing,” he expounded anxiously,
“it’s faith-gittin’; it’s lovin’ God and seekin’ His grace, just
as you’re doin’ to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me!” cried Caleb suddenly. “Ef that don’t look
tempesty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will’s eyes went skywards and found indeed a livid patch of
gloom, like a ghastly sag of sky, suddenly splotched in the warm
blue. And as he looked, a zigzag flash stabbed through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick,” cried Caleb, indicating a fairly leafy oak, “git under
that tree!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” said Will, “it’s dangerous.” And a terrible peal
of thunder accentuated his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll hazard it,” said Caleb, hastening towards the shelter.
“The Lord is marciful—He can kill us when He pleases. He
ain’t got no need o’ lightnin’. But that’s gooin’ to pour like
billyho—and the rine falls alike on the just and the unjust—unless
the roighteous man’s got an umberrella.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will smiled, though humour was as far as ever from Caleb’s
intentions. Unwilling to desert the old man, and perhaps
weighing the improbability of an electric stroke against the
certainty of spoiling his jacket, and the last surviving sheen of
his boots, Will stood pluckily beside his parent, while, after
another celestial salvo, great drops began to patter on the leaves
and even to drip through them. “Lucky that thunder dedn’t
come in the middle o’ last night,” mused the old man gratefully
as it roared on. “It’s sech a bother dressin’ yourself agen to
set up till it stops. Hark at they Tommy Devils squealin’,” he
cried, indicating the startled swifts. But after a few minutes
Caleb’s patience gave out: the distant chiming of Chipstone
Church bells, with which the way had been piously enlivened,
was now chillingly inaudible; the thought that they would be
late for chapel gnawed at his heart; and dryness seemed a poor
equivalent for those missed moments of spiritual ecstasy. He
was about to dash through the storm, when the rain ceased as
suddenly as it came, the blackbirds began to whistle and forage
merrily, and the sun, bursting out more brilliantly than ever,
soon licked up the modicum of moisture that had percolated to
their Sunday exterior. But Caleb’s apprehensions were justified.
He had overrated the pace of his aged legs, and despite the gain
through Plashy Walk, he got no compensation for the missed
Half-Way Service, for when they arrived at the little meeting-house,
the Morning Service proper had begun.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The chapel of the Peculiars was one of the minor religious
edifices that did not aspire to the High Street. Behind an iron
gate and a petty stone courtyard, it displayed a gabled front,
with a roof of pantiles, and a row of dull windows of an ecclesiastical
order on either side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Will passed through the door, all his tardily born sympathy
vanished, and a wave of the old insufferable boredom smote him
like a breath of the steerage on his Atlantic steamer. Almost
ere his hat was off, his eye had taken in the whole once-familiar
scene, the painfully crude walls, a little dingier with the passing
of the years, the broad table-desk at the head of the hall, at
which Deacon Mawhood and the Elders throned it in Sunday
black, the rows of spruce wooden chairs sexually divided by a
gangway, and exhibiting in its left section a desert of elderly
females with a few oases of hobbledehoy girls. He thought of
St. Paul’s Cathedral, and calculated whimsically that if that
cost twopence to see, how much ought one not to pay to escape
seeing this!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if his entry meant ennui to himself, it was a most dramatic
event to the congregation. At first, indeed, this stranger in the
fashionable jacket was not associated with Caleb, whose return
to the fold was a separate thrill. It was believed for an instant
that a veritable gentleman had succumbed to the Truth, and even
when it was perceived that he was no other than Will Flynt, the
news of whose home-coming had reached the majority, the sensation
did not abate, for was not God still visibly with His peculiar
flock, turning back the hearts of the wanderers, whether of the
old generation or the young? A breath of new inspiration
shook the hall, and the grey-haired Brother who had just begun
reading the thirteenth chapter of Acts faltered in his mispronunciation
of Cyrene. As he went on droning out the chapter—surely
the longest in the Bible, chosen maliciously to depress him
further, thought Will—its burden of the people of God, set for
a light to the Gentiles, evoked a mounting exaltation, and those
who had come with no thought of testifying, found themselves
possessed of the Spirit. There was in particular a man with
mutton-chop whiskers, on the bench in front of Will, whose
body swayed with excitement, and who punctuated the reading
with breathless jerks of nasal interpolation. “Be-yu-tiful!”
“Yes!” “Amen!” “Thank Gord!” “Mercy!” and the like.
And when at last the chapter ended on the verse “And the disciples
were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost,” it lifted the
man to his feet and he poured forth the story of his sinful past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi was Church of England—in the choir—and wore black
and whoite gowns—and rang the bells—and was confirmed and
all—but Gord had never pardoned my sins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will stifled a yawn and looked towards the door. But the
rest of the audience hung upon the tale—the tale of a death-bed
repentance of Churchmanship and the miraculous recovery to
lead the better life of the Peculiar Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi asked the Elder to howd up my hands, so that Oi might
die praising Gord for the revelation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sobs came from the left benches, but they only fevered Will.
He sat in a dull fury, dazed by words that passed over his brain
without leaving a meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a thronging boy and boy—a land where we shall
never say ‘Good noight’—engraved in eternal brass—the Lord
shoines on your heart—sheep and goats—streets paved with pure
gold as it were transparent glass!” It was not till he felt his
arm clutched by Caleb in the old man’s excitement at hearing
this last phrase that Will connected such words with reality at
all, and they faded back into mere religion till a sudden mention
of “John in the oil of Patmos” shot up a quaint picture of a
too profuse anointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other speakers followed with the same transcendental vocabulary,
and then hymns, in an interval between which, the
black-garmented Deacon with a royal gesture, that seemed to
sweep away the remotest effluvium of aniseed or moleskins, sent
Will a hymn-book by a deferentially wriggling Brother. It
seemed an ironic revenge for the book he had flung into the
bushes, but it saved him from the oppressive proximity of his
father’s, which he had been sharing; for the old man, though he
could not read the book, liked to hold it as he had always held
it with Martha, and indeed could not have sung without feeling
it at his fingers’ ends. Will turned its pages with curiosity,
thinking of Bundock’s “village idiot,” and noting that it was
still published by a village barber. Then a gaunt, horn-spectacled
man was seized of the Spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been looking for a han’kercher,” he began, to Will’s
surprise. “I’ve been looking for a han’kercher,” he repeated.
“I’ve been looking for a han’kercher,” he recapitulated with
rising rhetoric, “to wipe my tears away.” But the thrilling
level, of this exordium was not maintained, and the stock phrases
started again, merciless, unendurable, beating on Will’s brain till
they beat vainly against the depths of his reverie—or was it his
doze? Ah, surely that was Jinny’s horn at last! No, it was
only his father blowing emotionally into his red cotton handkerchief—too
huge to need looking for—a duplicate of that which
held their meals. Besides, Jinny wouldn’t be blowing her horn
of a Sunday. But why didn’t she come to chapel, the graceless
minx? Was she careering around with that Farmer Gale, or
was it her grandfather’s illness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>If flighty young girls, with hearts sound at bottom, would
come here and unfold the error of their independent ways, the
practice of confession might be justified, and chapel-service
become both useful and exciting. But these faded people, these
ungainly men and fubsy females! Who on earth cared for their
drab histories? Ah, there was Mother Gander, not so podgy as
most—in the blue silk of auld lang syne—if only <span class='it'>she</span> would get
up—or even Charley Mott—there would be some spark of interest.
But no, the horn-spectacled bore held the floor pitilessly, and
the phrases beat on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be-yu-tiful, be-yu-tiful words—I thought I should die!—Poor
me! What a comfort in them words!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the nasal voice, its fervour unallayed by its own outpouring,
still punctuated the other speeches with jerky interpolations.
“Praise the Lord!” or “Glory!” came with fiery iteration, and
sometimes this saint with the mutton-chop whiskers said “Lord
bless me!” or “Lord bless my soul!” and these frayed and almost
meaningless ejaculations seemed full of a startling significance in
<span class='it'>his</span> mouth and nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Bridges, they said to me, how’s your soul? I
couldn’t give ’em a straightforward answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will woke up again. It was not now the horn-spectacled
speaker—he had apparently been wiped off the floor at last, and
was not even visible—it was a man with a humorous twinkle
and a red beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if they had asked me, how’s your body——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a faint snigger from a thick-set girl, instantly
repressed by her shocked mother; but after Will had extracted
what relief he could from this incident, he tried vainly to extract
from the anecdote the exciting edification it held for the others.
“How can I go to Romford and tell people I haven’t got salvation?”
A dramatic crisis indeed for all save Will, who did not
even stifle his yawn. The man’s journey to Romford seemed
infinitely unimportant compared with journeys going on every
Tuesday and Friday, and despitefully checked on Sunday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once the door opened, but it was only for a shambling youth
in his teens, and Will did not share the satisfaction of the congregation
at this new, if belated, proof of their vitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not afeared, no, not the humblest of us,” pursued the
red-bearded man, catching fresh inspiration from this continuous
rise in their numbers. “And why? Because we don’t go to
work without a Partner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here at last was a definite image through the blur, and if Will
in a vivid flash saw a working-partner for himself in a less sublime
incarnation than the speaker had in mind, he was for once as
a-quiver as his father, who now, albeit with the stock exclamation
of “Be-yu-tiful!” proceeded to add real tears to the contents
of his capacious handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Will became attentive again, it was a new voice testifying,
and the matter seemed quite sensational.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They used to be carried away and buried in a day. But
when our Brother Bundock’s boy got it, we had a special prayer-meeting,
and even the marks were light!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! So it was only the postman’s smallpox. He looked
round in vain for Her Majesty’s servant: indeed a general
consciousness that the hero of the story was ungratefully absent,
damped its appeal—only the man with the mutton-chop whiskers
called out with unabated ardour, “Glory!” Will felt that the
glory was to Bundock, thus valiantly sticking to his lack of
convictions. More than even during the last week, life at Little
Bradmarsh seemed impossible, as impossible as in his boyhood;
better had he rushed with the mob of his mates to California;
even now it was probably the best thing to do with his ninety
pounds, unmanly though it were to flee and leave this girl
carrier with her arrogance unbroken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her absence, if only one of the females would get up! That
would be at least a change. But no! The sex was shy to-day,
though the forenoon was, he remembered, the traditional time
for its testifyings. Perhaps it was the presence of this stalwart
young stranger that tongue-tied it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the males seemed to be telling their soul-stories <span class='it'>at</span> him,
challenging his eye, appealing to his black jacket—or was that
only a morbid impression of his? An outsider might have been
touched by the thread of spiritual poetry in these outwardly
commonplace lives, but Will, being of them, had the familiarity
that breeds boredom, if not contempt. And contempt, too, was
not wanting to this elegantly clad and much-travelled connoisseur
of men and women and creeds, who had seen even French cathedrals
in Canada, and knew that Roman Catholics were not the
scarlet beasts his infancy had somehow imagined them. Once he
caught Mr. Charles Mott’s eye fixed upon him with a curious,
wondering gaze, which seemed to change to a wink as eye met
eye. Will’s eye, however, remaining serious, a flush overspread
the ex-potboy’s face, and he looked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Will’s contempt passed into alarm when, at a sudden pause
in the testifyings, all other eyes unquestionably converged on
him. He turned as red as Charley Mott, and glued his eyes to
his hymn-book, not daring to look up till another voice indicated
that the Spirit had found a more willing tongue for its organ.
But his relief was mixed with disgust, for it was the dry voice of
the original grey-haired reader, and it seemed bent on a sermon
which had not even the mitigated brightness of a confession.
Then, autobiography seemed suddenly to break through it, for
Will’s wandering thoughts were fixed by an anecdote about
riding to Rochester seven miles on a donkey on a winter’s
evening. “Lord bless me!” interpolated the nasal voice, so
distracting Will that he never understood how the story led up
to a doctor’s remark: “I must have your leg off,” a design the
medical materialist appeared to have carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will tried to peer under the table to see the preacher’s peg,
but failing to perceive any signs of corkiness, concluded that the
anecdote was not personal. He gathered that after this melancholy
amputation by impotent Science, Faith had sufficed to
keep the rest of the man together. Medicine had subsequently
proclaimed he was in a galloping consumption, “but he ain’t
dead yet—he’s still sound and whole,” cried the preacher paradoxically,
to the applausive “Glory!” of the tireless commentator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another illustrious example of regeneration—the preacher kept
Will awake by recounting—had begun life as a parson. But
none is beyond hope; even in the sacristy one is not safe from
the Spirit, and unable to go any longer through the flummeries
and mummeries of the Established Church, he had given up his
living and fallen—at one time—so low that he was glad to become
a potman in a public-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All eyes were here turned towards the unfortunate Charley
Mott, and from his squirming figure to Mother Gander, sitting so
stern and stiff; but the tension relaxed when the preacher—perhaps
tactfully—went on to mention that it was at “The
White Hart” in Colchester: where the landlord and landlady
had both “parsecuted” him. They were now both dead.
(“Glory!” from the nasal punctuator.) “I am sorry they are
dead,” said the preacher magnanimously. “But the Lord’s arm
is not short.” And while they were well dead, Will learnt that
their poor, persecuted potman had now a chapel of his own,
where he preached “Full Salvation.” Twenty or thirty were, it
appeared, saved regularly and punctually every Sunday evening.
“Glory!” trumpeted the nasal voice, and again Will, sullen
and glowering, felt that the whole congregation was palpitating
with expectation that he would leap to his feet and declare
himself similarly saved, or at least not lost during his long
absence. But he was not going to make a fool of himself, he
told himself harshly. He would sooner face the ordeal of escape,
of running the gauntlet of the Brothers and Sisters, and he
looked round wildly towards the door, perceiving with satisfaction
that the late youth had left it slightly ajar. Then, to his
joy and the congregation’s disappointment, another worshipper
took the word, or was taken by it; Bidlake, the bargee, with his
dog-eyes now shining and his shaggy face sublimated, who
declared with touching fervour that he would praise God as long
as breath was in him, and with the death-rattle in his throat he
would cry: “You can do, Gord, what you like with me!”
Ephraim recalled the coup by which he had converted his wife,
whom family sorrows had made an infidel. “Ef you won’t goo
to heaven with me, says Oi, Oi’ll goo to hell with you!” Now
they both pulled and poled together and were happy—so happy,
despite family losses and troubles. “Most men ain’t fit to live
nor ready to die. Just drifters. Throw ’em the life-line—the
life-line afore they drift away!” And with a vivid gesture he
threw an imaginary rope. By accident or design it was in Will’s
direction, and again the poor young man, with a stifling sense of
being lassoed, became the cynosure of every eye. But, fortunately
for him, Ephraim Bidlake did not pause here, and his
rhapsody poured on; “Glorious truth”—“one generation to
the tother”—“the prayer of roighteousness”—“come as you
are”—“wain to trust in man”—a veritable cascade of phrases
that, falling on Will’s head, gradually lowered it in sleep. An
impromptu speech is usually one the speaker cannot wind up,
and the worthy bargee went on tangling himself up more and
more, till it looked doubtful if he would ever have come to a
stop, had not something happened which stole even <span class='it'>his</span> breath
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the interstice of the door came suddenly sidling a
little white dog. But this accession to the congregation produced
no joy, merely a sense of profanity as it pattered up the
central parting, leaving, moreover, wet prints of its paws.
Springing without hesitation or apology upon the sleeper’s best
trousers, it curled itself up comfortably with a grunt. Assuredly
Will was not fated to-day to escape the centre of the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man recognized Nip instantly, and his yawn of
awakening changed into a gasp, and his somnolent pulse into a
precipitate beat. The animal’s leap was indeed sudden enough
to startle the strongest heart. Will turned his head instinctively
towards the door—oblivious even of his damped trousers—but
there was no sign of Nip’s mistress. Still, whether she was in
the vicinity or not, the dog was clearly out of place. Grasping
his pretext of escape firmly by the collar and clasping his
struggling opportunity to his breast, he stole from the meeting-house.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>He expected to see Nip’s owner outside. In his reading of the
situation she had arrived so late that while she was hesitating
whether to come in, the shameless dog had burst through the
door, attracted doubtless by the aroma of all those dinner-packets,
and this had made her still more ashamed to enter.
But the quaint little street was bare of Jinny. So sunless did
it appear without her, that he scarcely noticed that the sky
was actually overcast again, and that the black cloud had regathered.
He stood still, hesitating; in which relaxed mood of
his the spasmodic struggles of the animal were successful, and
Will became painfully aware that he was alone with his moist
trousers and his London coat snowed over with little hairs, while
Nip, after some preliminary gambollings and barkings at the
recovery of the liberty he had himself abandoned, was vanishing
into the High Street. So assured were Nip’s movements that
Will divined at once he had only to follow him to restore him to
his mistress, and without waiting even to brush off the little
white hairs, he darted towards the street corner, and was happily
just in time to see the excellent creature trotting into the courtyard
of “The Black Sheep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His pleasure was not, however, free from surprise. What was
Jinny doing at her business headquarters on the Lord’s Day?
Or had she come in her cart to chapel, and put it up there? He
ran towards the picturesque stable-yard. There were a good
many chaises, gigs, dog-carts and even carriages standing—the
countryside drove to its churches—but there was no trace of
either Jinny or Methusalem, while Nip was standing with hang-dog
air by the doorstep, under a poster of “Duke’s Marionettes.”
But as Will drew nearer, he turned tail, sauntered down the
passage, surveyed the painted hand, and then with an air of
decision bounded up the stairs. Ah, she would be in the parlour!
And Nip’s follower bounded upstairs too, keeping closely to heel.
But no! Nip was not on dining bent, though the door was
open. Rejecting all the appetizing scents that already emanated
from the eating-room, Nip pit-patted along the dusky corridor
and began whining and scrabbling outside a closed and numbered
door. Very soon it receded before his pleadings; and as he
scampered in, “You poor dog!” came out in the girlish voice that
had so lacerated him with “Fol de rols!” But not the worst
of that musical torment could vie with the jar to his heart-strings
when, through the reclosing door, came another unforgettable
voice with the jovial interrogatory: “Well, Nip, and what was
the parson’s text?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered now—with a cold sick horror—that this was
the very bedroom from which indignant housemaids had excluded
its tenant—yes, there was Reynard opposite with his glassy eye
and his erected brush. Possibly Tony Flip was not even up.
That was what came of minxes driving Methusalems! Instead
of being at divine service, like all God-fearing humanity, she was
coquetting—or worse—with a mountebank in an inn bedroom.
Yet he felt he must not spy upon her—any moment, too, she
might come out—and he hurried downstairs and stood on the
step under the ironwork lamp, louring like the great black
cloud, which he now perceived to be in heaven-sent harmony
with his mood. And that drivelling patriarch had foamed at the
mouth when he had hinted that woman’s place was not a cart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jinny did not keep him more than five endless minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Will,” she cried gaily, as she tripped from the passageway
with Nip in her arms. “What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the broad frame of her bonnet set off the picture of her
face! Small wonder a loose-living showman found it bewitching.
Not so William Flynt—with his high ideals of womanhood!
Even to be called “Will” was provoking rather than flattering:
he felt it now less the perquisite of the old friend than the proof
of an indiscriminating levity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come for the dinner,” he said coldly. Nip gazed straight
at him with his mild brown eye, but although Will did not suppose
that the brute would open its mouth like Balaam’s ass and give
him away, he could not look it in the head. He turned his
shoulder on dog and damsel and stared at the poster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could have dinner with you,” replied Jinny frankly.
“But I must be off to feed Gran’fer. Farmer Gale’s trap should
be here by now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He drives you home too?” He turned towards her, startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Within half a mile—it <span class='it'>is</span> a treat for me to have another
carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he isn’t a Peculiar,” he observed severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he’s a Wesleyan like Gran’fer, who used to drive his
father about. He puts up at ‘The Chequers’ hard by his
chapel—his service ought to be over. I hope his horse hasn’t
taken fright again—we had just got to the High Street when
the storm broke, and at the first flash the horse was off,
galloped miles beyond the town before he could be got to a
standstill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might have killed you, the silly!” cried Will, meaning
the farmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Jinny simply, meaning the animal. “By the
time he was walked warily back, it was too late to go in. But
I don’t wonder Nip was worried about me. You see he likes to
run behind the trap, poor fellow”—she wasted a kiss upon his
unresponsive head—“and he always comes up in time to say
good-bye at the chapel door, where he hangs about till I come
out. But this time, of course, he must have been wandering
about in search of me. He wasn’t there when I passed just
now. Mr. Flippance declares he must have gone to Chipstone
Church, in the idea I’d suddenly joined it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the girlish laugh rang out, dissipating some of his humours
as much by its joyousness as by the innocent mention of the
Showman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why shouldn’t you join it, Miss Quarles?” he said.
“It can’t be duller than chapel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now, Will.” She shook a serious finger. “You ought
to have gone to chapel yourself this morning. And don’t call
me Miss Quarles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I prefer to call you Miss Quarles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why not Jinny?” Her voice was plaintive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because everybody else calls you that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that any reason why you should call me Miss Quarles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can’t see it——!” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t, and I hope you won’t call me Miss Quarles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I won’t answer to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, Will, it’s not my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gasped. “Not your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed merrily at his discomfiture. “It’s a long story
and Farmer Gale will be here. Hulloa,” she went on, making
his confusion worse confounded, “how did Nip’s hairs get on
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed, and flicked nervously at his coat. “There are
other white dogs,” he said evasively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t let him spoil your coat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about your bodice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mine isn’t new and Londony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gratified at her perception: still more at her setting
down Nip. That animal, however, was in the rampageous mood
which always followed his restoration to freedom, and he began
leaping up at his mistress’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down, Nip, down! Oh, I do believe he’s bitten through my
new glove!” She pulled it off ruefully to examine the damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sensible dog!” Will growled. “He knows you oughtn’t to
be wearing Mr. Flippance’s gloves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her own little white teeth flashed out in a mocking smile:
“Lucky you are going to buy me another pair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! Why, you wouldn’t let me when I offered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not. I’m thinking of the pair you’ll be owing me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Owing you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t suppose you’ll win the wager, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that!” He was disconcerted again. “Of course I’ll
win it,” he said defiantly in a bombastic burst. “It won’t take
me a day’s practice to blow down the walls of Jericho.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “So you do remember your Bible. Well, I’ll
be satisfied if you blow Nip back from a rabbit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see. Have you superscribed again?” he asked
pompously, assured of his accuracy this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet—I expect the horn’ll be at Chipstone by Tuesday—you
shall have it the same evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the next day I’ll be wanting gloves,” he said loftily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see—or rather hear. What size do you take,
though?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know—twice yours, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not twice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sure!” And he suddenly prisoned her little ungloved
hand between his brawny palms. “I could easily crush it,” he
said, with a strange desire to do so, pressing it indeed almost to
hurting-point. At that instant a far-palpitating blueness transfigured
the courtyard, and from above-stairs came a terrific
racket as if all the plates and dishes in the dining-room were
hurling themselves at one another. Will felt the girl’s fingers
curl spasmodically round his and hold them tight: her face went
white, and he seemed to hear her heart thumping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be frightened!” he said, with his first manly satisfaction
in her. Surely she was clinging to him for protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be a fireball down the chimney,” she observed with
disappointing coolness. “There was one came down last year
in Long Bradmarsh and killed a poor little chimney-sweep who
had got stuck in the flue. It’ll set the chimney on fire, I expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This rain will put it out,” he said, still cheerfully conscious
of her warm fingers, and feeling a joy in the deluge that had
been so damp in his father’s company. She drew back, however,
into the passage to avoid the big plopping and ricochetting rain-drops
and her hand got disentangled. “What fun if it’s fallen
down Mr. Flippance’s chimney,” she laughed. “Make him get
up early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her laughter seemed to ring untrue, hysterical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he up yet?” he asked, trying to speak lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he never gets up on a Sunday—not properly, I mean.
I saw him half up, but he’s gone back to bed and is already
snoring—I heard him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could you hear him?” he asked, with careful
carelessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I was in his daughter’s room, whiling away the time of
waiting—she’s got ten times his sense—when, woke up by our
voices, I suppose, in he trails through the communicating door
in his fancy dressing-gown, yawning like a mouse-trap, and asks
me to buy him a horse at the fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A horse at the fair!” Scarcely had he enjoyed the relief of
working out that he had taken the harmless adjoining bedroom
for the Showman’s, when this new blow struck him, like hooves
on his chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I wouldn’t listen to him,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not!” His breast expanded again. “How can
a woman understand buying horses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t mean that.” Jinny was distinctly colder. “I
mean it’s the Lord’s Day. He’ll have to repeat his order on
Tuesday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely you wouldn’t go to a horse fair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because—it’s—it’s so horsey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed again. “And so fairish, too, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he want a horse for?” he asked sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose it’s for dinner—he isn’t a Frenchy. But he’s
got a caravan, hasn’t he?—and he has to begin his summer
tour soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why can’t he buy his own horses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That infant? Why his last horse died of old age at four!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about that sensible daughter of his?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She hasn’t got horse-sense,” said Jinny, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t see how it comes into your business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A carrier has to buy whatever she’s asked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever she can carry. You can’t carry a horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but it can carry me. Besides, I’ve often carried a calf
or a pig, and where am I to draw the line?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be buying elephants next,” he said, with a bitter
remembrance of Mr. Flippance’s story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m too old for gingerbread,” she replied unexpectedly.
“But I haven’t forgotten the one you gave me once.” He
trembled under her radiant gratitude, with its evocation of the
poetry of childhood. But a convulsive bound forward on the
part of Nip broke up the argument. “Ah, here’s Farmer Gale
coming along,” she said cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just like the fellow, he thought, to come just at that moment.
And his resentment at the arrival of the dog-cart was not even
mitigated by the watery spectacle presented by its red-faced
driver, whose personable and still youthful figure rose from a
streaming tarpaulin, to which a hat with an unremoved mourning-band
contributed its drippings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t go in that rain,” Will protested. “Let him go
without you—I’ll order a trap myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you said you were dining here—I can’t wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced—his white lie had come home like a curse to roost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can dine with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about Gran’fer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can dine at home.” But she scarcely heard him.
She was already fastening a handkerchief over her Sunday
bonnet—a fascinating process. “There’s a good cover—I’ll
snuggle right in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shameless, he thought, riding about cheek by jowl and skirt
by trouser with a young man not even of her own faith. That
thin tiny boy sandwiched between was no real separation: why,
the tarpaulin almost swallowed him under! They ought at
least to sit back to back, and if there was any chivalry in the
pudding-faced lout, he would transfer the tarpaulin to the back
seat. How could Jinny forget that the magnate of Little
Bradmarsh—cursèd Cornish interloper—was no fit company for
the likes of her? He wondered that people did not warn her:
but they were inured to her vagaries, he supposed. And even if
the man meant honourably, in his reckless passion, how dare a
widower with a great thumping boy approach a rosebud? Ah,
now she was talking to this second-hand, warmed-up aspirant,
who had already killed off one wife; inquiring sweetly about his
animal’s behaviour under the recent flash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady as a plough-horse!” came the cheery reply. “My
eye, Jinny, you did handle him wonderful. I reckon you saved
my life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about my own?” With a laugh whose gaiety
stabbed, she sprang upon the step. “Good-bye, Will. Hope
you’ll enjoy your dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Miss Quarles,” he said coldly. “I mean, Miss——”
But before he had realized he could not fill up the blank, the
trap had started, and he could not even bound behind, like the
joyous-barking Nip. Nothing tangible was left of the whole
delectable and distressing episode except some white hairs on the
fashionable fabric of Moses &amp; Son.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope you’ll enjoy your dinner!” Her last words still rang
in his ear. His dinner! Cold meat wrapped in a “muckinger,”
and consumed on chapel benches among drab Elders and elderly
Sisters and better-lost Brothers and dismal rat-catching Deacons.
No, sooner a crust and cheese at the bar. But why not roast
beef and Yorkshire pudding in the parlour—why not make his
lie true? Yes, lies were reprehensible: truth was always best,
and his chaps began to water with ethical excitement. But
alas, with a sudden misgiving he put his hand in his pocket.
Not a farthing! In the agitation of his chapel-going, he had
forgotten to transfer his purse to the Sunday suit—nay, even the
ninety pounds were left in the discarded waistcoat, he remembered
with an unreasonable chill. He was to be nailed to his lie, then.
True, he might possibly get credit, but it was an awkward
situation at best. No, better go back to his cold meat—besides,
his poor old father would be wondering and waiting. It would
be cruel to desert and distract him, and, the rain appearing
somewhat thinner, he turned up his coat-collar and started out,
almost colliding at the archway with the Mott couple, lovingly
entwined under a spacious umbrella. They at least had no need
to dine in chapel. Mr. Charles Mott looked at him again with
the same curious wonder. “You’re not going back?” he cried
involuntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t desert my dad!” Will answered, somewhat shamefacedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he must eat, Charley darling,” Mother Gander intervened.
“You know how bad our Sunday dinners are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t even got any money with me,” he cried, with a last
wild hope. But Mother Gander did not respond to his longing
for truth. “Lend him the umbrella, dearest,” she said ruthlessly.
“We’ve another for the afternoon service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accepting it with mitigated gratitude—the umbrella he was
trusted with was worth more than the dinner, he thought
bemusedly—he moved more slowly to the chapel; wondering,
too, how hotel-keeping could be reconciled with the Sabbatarian
conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found the meeting-house now turned into an eating-house.
The congregation had, however, visibly thinned: only those who
had no hosts or homes in Chipstone remaining for this love-feast,
with the exception of Deacon Mawhood, who, rather than go
home to his wife, remained at the table as presiding dignitary,
flanked by great glass jugs of water. The ravages in the ranks
appeared to Will an eloquent testimony to the spread of the
doctrine in Chipstone proper: in his young days the sect had
been more suburban and rural, and the chapel at that hour had
seethed with hungry pilgrims. Still, there was quite a happy
hubbub, and the spectacle, with its real sense of brotherhood,
struck from him more sympathy than anything in the service;
and when a Sister told her cherub not to “goffle” so, he was
mysteriously touched by the old word, and the memories it
roused, to a sincerer respect for the creed which satisfied Jinny.
What fun the boys had had in the wagon, driving home with her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb was chewing a hunk of bread and meat. The handkerchief-parcel—shrunk
like the congregation—incarnadined the
bench. “Oi had to begin,” he explained apologetically, “seein’
as Oi’d said grace, expectin’ you back every second, and it
seemed foolin’ with the Lord to wait more than ten minutes.
Pity that dog worrited you. Be-yu-tiful things were brought
out when you was gone. Where did you git to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He evaded the question. “I’m not hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not arter that walk of ourn!” cried Caleb incredulously.
“Oi count you’ve had your dinner somewhere else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, off the dog!” he said a bit crossly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb smiled. “Oi’ll not believe that,” he said with an air of
infinite cuteness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have a drink,” condescended Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do!” Caleb passed him a large tin mug of water. “And
there’s plenty more where that come from.” Will knew it was
Brother Quint—the “snob” or shoemaker who lived next door—who
supplied these limitless streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t she beautifully polished?” Caleb went on naïvely, when
his thirsty son set the mug down. “Holds noigh a quart—Oi
never see sech mugs nowhere else! And Brother Quint’ll fill it
with biling for our tea. There, Will! There’s your favourite
sausages mother put in for you, special. None o’ your dogs in
that!” And he chuckled, brimming over with holy glee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cooled by the long draught, Will allowed himself to be seduced
by the veal sausages, and, finding with surprise that the first
slid down his throat in a twinkling, he was soon depleting the
parcel into a mere “muckinger.” And at this Caleb’s innocent
happiness was complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the fate that stalks mortals at their culminating felicities
now sped its arrow. In excavating a pickled walnut from the
remains of the parcel, Caleb loosed a minute cardboard box,
which sprang maliciously to the floor and then, to the agitation
of the neighbours, rolled round and round towards the table
under the very eyes of the rat-catcher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Deacon stooped down zealously to pick it up, and then
held it on high. It was a pill-box! “Who brought this?” he
cried in stern prophetic accents, across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happy hubbub ceased, the holy glee was frozen. In a
tense silence all eyes were turned on the profane symbol. Will
saw his wretched father’s face go red and white, and his scraggy
throat work painfully below the ragged white beard. Both the
Flynts guessed at once that the careful Martha had slipped into
the packet her husband’s usual pill before meals!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a dreadful moment. For a space in which all nature
seemed to hold its breath, Caleb sat rigid and dumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose propity is this?” asked the Deacon still more sternly,
and Will divined the mighty struggle going on in his father’s
quaint conscience; casuistic questions as to how far a pill-box
conveyed unconsciously had been “brought” by him, or in
what sense pills administered to him remorselessly from without
could be said to be his “property.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly Caleb’s lips opened. “Oi count ’twas in my
parcel,” he said in tremulous accents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sublimity of the confession thrilled Will: he even felt a
curious moisture at his eyes. But before the Deacon, sitting
there like a judge about to pronounce sentence, could say a
word, a blinding glare, followed almost instantaneously by an
appalling crashing and smashing right overhead, showed that
nature had indeed held its breath and had now spoken in flame
and thunder. Will’s first reflection when the daze had passed
away, and the congregation found itself and its building providentially
safe, was that it was indeed lucky his father had spoken
first; otherwise his confession might have seemed extorted by
terror. But Joshua Mawhood was not the Deacon to let such
a situation pass without profit. “The Lord havin’ spoke,
brethren,” said he, “there ain’t no need for <span class='it'>my</span> opinion. The
thing Oi hate most in this lower world is hypocrisy and dissemblin’.
‘Roight up and down, Jo Perry,’ as the sayin’ goos.
Ef we ain’t been destroyed, as we sat here guzzlin’ and guttlin’,
’tain’t no merit of the congregation, ’tis because the Lord bein’
marciful don’t destroy Sodom and Gomorrah so long as there’s
one roighteous man.” He rose majestically and drew himself
up to his full height, and held the pill-box even higher. “Brother
Flynt, if you’ll kindly step out, Oi’ll hand you back your propity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No fiercer punishment could have been devised for Caleb’s
gentle soul: the sinner, isolated, passing through his shrinking
Brethren and Sisters, must come forward as to a confession table.
No wonder the poor man held back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi don’t need it now, Deacon,” he said, with lips almost as
white as his hair. “You can throw it away ef you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With malicious enjoyment the Deacon slowly and solemnly
lifted the lid of the pill-box and dipped in his fingers, to hold up
the impious contents to the public execration. Then his face
changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s salt!” he cried in angry disappointment. It was
as if the devil were playing thimblerig with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi was thinkin’ the missus had ought to put some in,” said
Caleb, beaming again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman of the baby-cart now found herself possessed of
the Spirit. She sprang to her feet, a baby on either arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are the salt of the earth,” she shrilled, “wherewith the
others shall be salted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallelujah!” burst from the mutton-chop whiskers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallelujah!” responded the congregation, and a great
anthem rolled out, outshouting the thunder.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>To the disappointment of his father, who still hoped he would
testify, Will would not stay for the Afternoon Service. But his
worthy sire could bear a disappointment after the revulsion in
his favour, he thought. He had to take back the umbrella to
the Motts, he insisted, or, with this weather, the good Samaritans
might be unable to return to their worshipping: in any case he
had to see somebody at “The Black Sheep” on urgent business:
business, he corrected hastily, of a spiritual nature, calculated to
save certain souls from temptation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Oi’m glad the Sperrit’s workin’!” said Caleb, “and
do ye git back to mother quick as you can, for it ain’t fair as
she should be left at home, time Oi’m enjoyin’ myself. Not that
’tis my fault there ain’t no chapel for Christy Dolphins—!” He
checked himself and added hurriedly: “Do ye don’t tell her
about the pill-box: happen she’d think Oi was wexed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do ye don’t say you can’t carry a box to Chipstone!”
mocked Will gaily, glad to be released. “And of a Sunday too—you
old Sabbath-breaker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb did not smile: the episode had left too deep a scar.
“Oi count the Deacon’s in the roight,” he said. “ ’Tis hypocrisy
and dissemblin’ to take pills at home and salt in public. Oi
count Oi’ll testify to the truth this arternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you only take pills to keep off the indigestion, not to
cure it,” urged Will, giving him his own plea back. “Besides,
salt is a sort of medicine too: without it you might get scurvy
and goodness knows what.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb shook his head. “Lot’s wife wasn’t turned into a
medicine. Any man in his seven senses knows the difference
’twixt puttin’ salt or medicine on his wounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving his father to execute his sublime purpose, Will went
off on his own mission under protection of the big Mott umbrella.
In returning it, he learnt that even its great ribbed dome had
not saved Mr. Mott from a wetting, in consequence of which and
his delicate health he was now imbibing stiff glasses of grog in
his bedroom, hovered over by the anxious Mother Gander. It
was pathetically out of the question, Will gathered, for Brother
Mott to attend chapel again that day. Will’s “urgent business”
lay, however, with Mr. Anthony Flippance: the soul to be saved
being Jinny’s, now menaced with still further soilure from the
gross contacts of horse-copers, cadgers, kidders, butchers, drovers,
shepherds, swineherds, touts, tramps, and all the tricksters and
pickpockets of the cattle-market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mission did not loom unpleasant, for although he resented
the fiction about the Crystal Palace and the stuffed elephant, the
tall talk was harmless enough—he had heard taller in America—and
he was not indisposed for ungodly society after the reek of
the chapel. That the genial Showman would instantly see the
matter from his point of view he did not doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tony Flip was not in the dining-room even in dishabille,
and the waiter was still so occupied with late or leisurely diners
as apparently to be unable to conjure him up. “I’ve just taken
him up his breakfast,” he said, with an envious sigh. “No. 42.
You’ll find him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to intrude thus on the Showman’s privacy seemed indelicate:
he waylaid a chambermaid in the corridor and asked her
to tell Mr. Flippance a gentleman would be glad to see him when he
had finished his meal. She brought back a mysterious answer as
from Miss Flippance that he never saw clean-shaven gents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will fired up as at an insult. Evidently the rogue was not
going to be so malleable: that daughter of his, too, he remembered,
had no proper respect for Jinny. “Tell ’em I’ll wait here
till my beard grows!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chambermaid hung back, giggling. He felt in his pocket
for a sixpence—again encountering only lining. “If you don’t
take my message, I’ll kiss you,” he menaced. It was a jest that
never failed him, and it did not fail now, though the fleeing
“tucker-in” giggled more than ever. He watched her enter the
lion’s den, but hardly had she done so, when the noble animal
himself padded forth, grinning like a Cheshire cat, his fork
protruded like a claw, and just-spluttered coffee dripping from
his great jaws over the breast of his flamboyant hundred-stained
hide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he?” he roared genially to the dark corridor.
“Come in! Come in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will advanced defiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it’s you! I was wondering what wit heaven had dropped
with the thunder! Yankee yumour—I ought to ha’ guessed it.”
And he nearly spitted Will on his fork in his enthusiastic effort
to shake hands. “ ‘I’ll wait till my beard grows’—ha, ha, ha!
That goes in this very night—no, there’s no show to-night, hang
it! Don’t go, Polly,” he called, as he pulled Will into the room
over a barrier of Bluchers and Wellingtons and even Hessian boots
with silken tassels, “we must get that into <span class='it'>Hamlet</span>. When I
say to Ophelia, ‘Get thee to a nunnery; go, farewell’— I’ll
wind up ‘Until thy beard grows.’ That’ll be your new cue,
Polly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’ll spoil the scene,” Miss Flippance protested, poised
in a morning wrapper in the open doorway between the two
rooms. She was mysteriously mantled in aromatic clouds, like
the spirit in <span class='it'>The Mistletoe Bough</span>, yet her father did not seem to
be smoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, Polly,” he persisted, “it’s just the right grotesque
spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll be a laugh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The one thing <span class='it'>Hamlet</span> needs. Even the ghost don’t carry
it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better give <span class='it'>me</span> the line,” persisted Miss Flippance.
“It’ll come better in the mad scene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll talk about it—I think you’ve seen our American
friend before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before and behind,” said Miss Flippance viciously, a scowl
traversing her pockmarks. “And since he left me in the lurch,
I wasn’t sorry to think I’d seen the back of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But as Miss Quar—as the Carrier hadn’t got your drumstick,
there was nothing to return for,” apologized Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why <span class='it'>have</span> you?” she snapped, and closed the door
behind her with a similar snap.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Polly’s in a pet,” commented her parent. “She don’t like
being worried by actors in search of jobs, specially on Sundays.
It’s your hairless phiz, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not an actor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not—she ought to have seen you haven’t the face—only
the razor: ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was vaguely resentful. “But I dare say I could black
my face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s more to the drama than Othello, and more to Othello
than burnt cork.” And Mr. Flippance laughed again as he
dropped into his wooden arm-chair and resumed his breakfast at
a little table ’twixt the bed-canopy and the window. “Sit
down, won’t you? Excuse my back—I can hear all you say
behind it. Ha, ha! That’s another good gag, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will, glancing round, saw that the chair not occupied by his
host was hopelessly littered by his garments, mixed with papers:
he therefore dropped on the high four-poster—it was now made—and
cleared his throat for action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have a drop of something,” Mr. Flippance threw
backwards, mistranslating the sounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you!” He must not be bribed or drugged, Will
felt: he had stern work before him. It was as well, however,
to placate the adversary. “Glad to hear the show’s a big
draw,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who told you that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Er—the Bradmarsh Carrier!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless her—she carries all the lies I tell her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t things rosy then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never lie on Sundays. Ha, ha, ha! Perhaps it’s just as
well Jinny won’t do business with me to-day. No, old man, I
ought to be middling mollancholy, as they say here. But I’m as
happy as the day is long—and it’s getting longer every day.” He
drained his coffee-cup voluptuously. “Never mind my business—what’s
yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine? I haven’t come on business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you <span class='it'>must</span> have a brandy.” He reached out and pulled
the green bell-rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No thank you. You see—” Will swung his legs hesitatingly.
“Surely you don’t think she ought to carry lies——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Bradmarsh Carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny! She has to carry anything—at the proper tariff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is it fair to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you mean our doing bumper business, she don’t know it’s
a lie, and her telling it helps to make it true. Why, you were
itching to see the show yourself, as soon as you heard other fools
were flocking.” He turned a grinning face. “Come now,
confess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t come to see the show,” Will contradicted, feeling
vaguely baffled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not, being Sunday. But what <span class='it'>did</span> you come for?
Cut the cackle and come to the ’osses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” he said eagerly. “I hear you want to buy one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flippance swung round, chair and all. “Then you <span class='it'>have</span>
come on business!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, have you got a horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I could get one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you don’t call that business!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mean to—!” Will was getting embarrassed. “It
just slipped out. What I want to ask of you is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where the devil is that waiter?” broke in the Showman,
reaching for the cord again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I mean is,” said Will, determined to get it out before
the waiter popped up, “that there’s a girl you’re leading into
brazen courses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A girl! Me!” Mr. Flippance pulled himself angrily to his
feet, and stood glaring at Will, with the snapped bell-cord in his
hand like a green serpent. “You son of Ananias, if you’ve
listened to any of those scandal-mongering swine you ought to be
jolly well ashamed of yourself. There isn’t a cleaner man—for
a widower—in all the circuit. Why, I could pile up the dollars—as
you call it—if I’d only darken my tent a bit, so that the
lovers of the drama could go rubbing their noses and licking one
another like the calves in the next field. But there isn’t a
brighter show this side of the Atlantic. Besides, my girls are
all wood—there’s not a flesh and blood female with me except
Polly, and she’s my own daughter, born on the right side of the
blanket, too. Which is more than can be said for all of us.
What may be <span class='it'>your</span> name, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has my name to do with it?” He got off the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has his name to do with it?” asked Mr. Flippance of
the waiter, who now shot in with a well-divined bottle and
appurtenances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg pardon, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you may, you son of a slug. Here, take this rope
and hang yourself with it! So you won’t tell your name, you
son of a flea,” he went on, when the waiter had spirited off
the breakfast-tray. “Well, here’s my back—bite away.” And
with a high tragic gesture he turned to open the brandy-bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not a backbiter,” said Will angrily. “I’m a front-puncher,
and my name is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind your name. I accepted you. You came like
the spirit of the May Day—mixed with the <span class='it'>Mayflower</span>. I
opened my heart to you. I gave you three names. I was Duke,
I was Anthony Flippance, I was Tony Flip.” He gurgled the
brandy into his glass. “I demanded no references. I entrusted
you with posters for my daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which I delivered honestly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But anonymously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Not for a million pounds would I hear it now. But
the girl’s name?” he turned round, glass in hand. “That at
least I beg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve mentioned it already. It’s—it’s the Carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny!” Tony Flip burst into an explosive laugh of relief.
“Fancy calling Jinny a girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what else would you call her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>you</span> just called her—the Carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if she is a carrier, why should you degrade her into a
horse-broker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all you mean, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be an idiot. Here, have a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will waved the glass away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like to send your daughter bargaining among a
lot of rough men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony grinned. “I don’t think Polly ’ud mind the men. It’s
the horse she’d come a cropper over. Jinny’s had a long experiance
of horses, and she’s smart enough to buy anything. If I
wanted the moon, she’d get it for me—and cheap too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why can’t you buy your own horses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Because I’m a child of nature—a simple player—who
wears his heart on his sleeve for daws to peck at. My last
mare crocked up in a week in the flower of her youth—seems to
have been bought in a knacker’s yard, shaved and singed and
brushed and combed till she was as shiny as a Derby winner.
They gingered her ears and jaws and cayenne-peppered her
nostrils till she seemed clothed in thunder, like the war-horse in
the Bible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will smiled despite himself. “And you expect a girl to see
through all that! Look here, I’ll buy your horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flippance paused in the act of imbibing. “Oh, <span class='it'>there</span> we
are,” he said, looking shrewd. “Want to cut out Jinny’s
business!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will’s cheeks became chromatically indistinguishable from his
hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! Do you think I want your dirty commission?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you think I want your stinking horse? Why the
devil do you come interfering?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was silent. Tony finished his glass like a victor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it ain’t the commission, what <span class='it'>are</span> you after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my business,” said Will sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I said!” crowed Tony. “But I’d rather pay
Jinny a quid than you a bob. She’s got her old grandfather
to keep!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and he’s as selfish and inconsiderate as you. But she
<span class='it'>shan’t</span> get you a horse, and there’s an end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho!” Brandy had made him genial again. “Who’s
going to prevent it? Now don’t say ‘<span class='it'>I</span> will,’ because that’s in
our dramas—attitude and all. Though judging by the way
you’ve been going on, Mr. Anon, I’m not so sure you <span class='it'>wouldn’t</span>
make an actor! Perhaps Polly smelt right and you <span class='it'>are</span> one after
all. But don’t you come disturbing my peace of mind, you son
of a star. Wild horses wouldn’t drag me back to the legitimate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re talking of caravan horses,” said Will, at once mystified
and mollified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to know all about it. I guess you ran a show
yourself in the States.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will smiled darkly. “That’s not your affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it might be. I’m not above a partner with capital.
Duke’s Marionettes are getting shabby. The ghost is nearly
black; Ophelia wants a new coat of paint. Harlequin is out of
joint and the Clown’s cheeks are worn white. And we’ve got
too few characters and too many plays. The public are on to
it when they see Hamlet turning up again in <span class='it'>The Beggar of
Bethnal Green</span>. Some new scenery too would smarten up the
show. I shan’t expect you to pull the strings—just put up the
chinkers and we’ll divvy up, you and me and Polly. Now don’t
say ‘No’ too quick. Drink it over.” And, beaming beneficence,
he again tendered Will the other glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time Will took it, hearing himself clink it against Tony’s
through a daze, as he asked himself whether, after all, this notion—utterly
fantastic and unexpected as it was—mightn’t be as
good a way as any other of investing his ninety pounds: he
would certainly be in a position then to stop Jinny from buying
the horse!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you say?” cried Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t know my name?” murmured Will, with the
stir of adventure and brandy in his veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! What’s in a name? A nose by any other name
would swell as red.” And, laughing, he clapped Will on the
shoulder. “We’ll spruce up the tent too, and slick up the
caravan—a dingy old hearse ain’t the best advertisement on a
tour. And why shouldn’t you take some of the parts? Pity to
waste your twang. We’d get some American figures made—cowboys
and slave-dealers and such—and spice our ghosts and
goblins with Colonel Bowie knives and Yankee yumour. We
might even turn the bridegroom in <span class='it'>The Mistletoe Bough</span> into a
rich New-Yorker, and make the bride moulder away in an
American trunk. There’s a fortune in it. I don’t mean in the
trunk—ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a last instinct of sanity Will observed maliciously that it
was Sunday. He merely meant to remind Tony that that was
his day for truth. But the Showman’s glass nearly fell from his
fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You too!” he said. “And that Jinny—as lively a girl as
ever stepped. And Mother Gander—as buxom a landlady as
ever bussed a bagman. What’s come over the East Anglian
circuit? And I took you for a man of the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unwilling to repudiate that status, Will remarked flabbily that
precisely as a man of the world he didn’t see any money in
marionettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No money!” Mr. Flippance swelled with indignation as he
pointed out that Drury Lane and the mines of Golconda were not
in it with marionettes, properly equipped and spring-cleaned; the
public was simply panting for high-class puppets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It goaded Will to emphasize his meaning. “Is this your
Sunday talk or your week-day talk?” he interrupted dryly.
“Didn’t you just tell me that you’re doing badly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flippance admitted it almost without a wince. And
had he not given the reason? To take money out you
must put money in. “I tell you there’s a fortune in it,” he
repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sunk?” asked Will blandly. He added vengefully that he
would consider a partnership when the stuffed elephant came
home from the Crystal Palace. Tony, in crimson comprehension,
rushed at the litter on the spare chair and dragged out a newspaper
from under the neckties. “Read that!” he said
sublimely, “the <span class='it'>Essex County Chronicle</span>!” And his semi-gilded
forefinger indicated a heavily blued passage. “Our
readers will be interested to know,” read Will, “that it is a
local showman who supplied the great stuffed elephant that
holds Her Majesty’s gorgeous howdah in Mr. Paxton’s marvellous
glass——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped the paper. “I beg your pardon!” he said, too
disconcerted to realize that the “local” showman need not
necessarily be Tony Flip. “But I really would rather not talk
business to-day, and I don’t know anything about yours—that
wasn’t my line in the States. I never even saw a puppet-show
in my life, outside Punch and Judy. A real live drama now——”
he concluded vaguely, meaning that he had at least seen real
plays, and utterly unforeseeing the effect the remark would have
upon his host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Tony Flip bounded like a large mechanical toy, plumped
down again in his chair, turned its back and his own to his
guest, and stuffing jewelled forefingers into both his ears cried
out: “Get thee behind me, Satan! Avaunt! Avaunt!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Me, Satan!” said Will, astonished. “Who ever heard of
Satan refusing to do business on Sunday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If his last innocent remark had produced convulsive effects in
a perpendicular direction, this set Tony Flip rolling from side to
side in his chair. “Yankee yumour,” he gasped between the
spasms. “Lord!” he said at last. “You’ll drive me to set
up a minstrel show, only to get that in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will, though puzzled, could hardly help being flattered by
these proofs of his facetious talents. It was strange, he thought,
how different the conversation went when he was with Jinny.
Then the laugh seemed always at his expense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think a minstrel show would be more fun,” he
observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony veered round with his arm-chair, ceased to laugh, and
regarded Will with large, reproachful eyes. “And you cant
about Sunday!” he said. “And then to come tempting me
back to that Witches’ Sabbath of a profession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nigger minstrels?” Will murmured, more dazed than
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As if nigger minstrels weren’t half-way to your <span class='it'>Othello</span>. No,
you son of Satan. To hell with your capital! Didn’t you hear
me say ditto to the rat-catcher? They <span class='it'>are</span> dens of the devil—theatres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do you run one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! I don’t class my show as a theatre. Marionettes keep
themselves to themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you play Shakespeare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony held up his fat glittering forefinger. “We pull Shakespeare’s
strings—Polly and me. But there’s no actors the
public can drag before the curtain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will admitted the difference, but not the moral distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ever met any actors and actresses?” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will could not pretend to that privilege—if Mr. Flippance and
his daughter refused to be counted—and there was a long silence,
in which Tony seemed to the outer eye to keep sips of brandy-and-water
lingering on his palate, though he was really—it
transpired—chewing the cud of bitter memories. For suddenly
he burst out: “I lived all my life with ’em. I’ve managed ’em
for years—or, rather, failed to manage ’em. Born in a Green
Room, rocked in a Witches’ Cauldron, and baptized in grease-paint.
My ma was a leading lady—she played heroines and my
father wrote the melodramas. And they know a good melodrama
at the ‘Eagle.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I’ve heard of the ‘Eagle’ in London,” said Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you know it by the song, perhaps:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Up and down the City Road,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>In and out the ‘Eagle.’</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>That’s the way the money goes,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pop goes the weasel!</span>”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard a weasel go pop,” Will laughed. “It was the
mouse, if anything, though I did once see a stoat crack up before
a cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s mien relaxed in a faint smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weasel was a tailor’s iron, he explained, pawned by the
reckless snip to raise money for treating the damsels who danced
with him on that open-air platform to which the “Eagle’s”
audience streamed out betwixt the drama and the farce. He
added simply: “That’s where my Don Juan of a dad first
clapped eyes on a girl, pretty, of course, but with no more acting
in her than Mother Gander. Yet, would you believe it, he
shoved her into the lead instead of ma, and wrote a piece all for
her, and what was worse it was a big go. That was the last straw,
and clasping me to her wounded bosom, she left him, poor ma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have thought she’d ha’ left him sooner,” murmured
Will, vaguely uncomfortable under these frank domestic revelations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t so easy to leave a man you’re not married to!” said
Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that surprises you?” said the Showman complacently.
With a cautious glance at his daughter’s door of communication,
he produced two cigars furtively from his washstand drawer—was
he forbidden to smoke, Will wondered. “You’ll find that
good,” he said, pressing one upon his guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he explained, as they puffed at these excellent
weeds in a new intimacy, “if a woman leaves her husband it
makes a scandal he don’t like, whereas a man that’s not tied is
only too glad to be rid of her. Oh, I ain’t defending ma, mind
you—it only shows she was a born actress. I dare say she’d
only sucked up to pa to get parts. But when he unstarred her,
fine emotional actress as she was, she could never get her foot in
again in London, to play leads I mean, for she was too proud
to play anything else. ‘I can play anything except second
fiddle,’ she used to say, and rather than cave in, she married a
fifth-rate manager, called Jim Flippance, who had only a fit-up
theatre (carries its own props, scenery, and proscenium, but not
open-air, you know), and made him put up pieces with a kid in
’em to keep me out of mischief, but it wasn’t long before I soared
out of the parental nest, and by the time they both joined the
majority, poor old birds, I’d been leading man or manager or
both in half a dozen theatres, two of ’em London houses.” Will
receiving this information with a silent curl of his smoke, as
though it were another elephantine claim, Mr. Flippance added
vehemently: “Real London theatres, mind you, not those
swindling gaffs for paying amateurs described by Boz—that’s
Charles Dickens, you know. You’ve read Dickens?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will shook his head. “Too heavy and high-class for me.
They don’t like him in the States either—I’ve heard he wrote a
piece against them——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but you should hear him read his ‘Christmas Carol!’
There’s a wasted actor for you! Lord, if I’d had the running
of that chap!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was more interested in the girl who cut out Mr. Flippance’s
ma. “I hope your father—your pa—” he substituted politely,
“married his new flame,” he said. Even through the glow of
the brandy and the blur of the smoke he was dismayed by this
dishevelled life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could he? He had a wife in Cork. Yes, I forgot to
say pa was Irish. I’ve always gone by my mother’s married
name, but you can have my father’s name if you wish!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for a million pounds,” said Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You Yankee yumorist!” Tony blew a playful puff of smoke
at him. “Well, you’ll see it if you come across the old ‘Eagle’
playbills or those of Flippance’s Fit-Up for that matter, for we
did all pa’s plays—ma had played them so long she knew all
the parts. Pa sent her a lawyer’s letter—for she didn’t even
trouble to change the titles or the author’s name—but she defied
him to wash his dirty linen in court, knowing how virtuous
his ‘Eagle’ public was, and that it might ha’ ruined him and
his moral melodramas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They seem a funny lot—stage folk,” Will commented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, there’s no bearing of ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will, relieved, said he was glad Mr. Flippance didn’t approve
of such morals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morals!” Tony glared at him. “Who’s talking of morals?
Men will be men and women women whether they’re pro’s or
public. You didn’t find America a Sunday-school, I reckon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will, coughing over his liquor, supposed a man could have his
fun anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I say!” said the Showman. “And on the
other hand I’ve known actors as respectable as your rat-catcher.
I’m one of ’em myself, as I told you just now. I’d seen too
many dead flies in the honey—and my Polly’s as pure as her
poor dead mother. No, it ain’t their morals that bother me, it’s
their ways. Holy Moses! To think of the time I had travelling
round managing these sons of dragons and hell-cats! I envied
ma and Flippance in the churchyard under their favourable
stone notices. The jealousies! The cat-and-dog bickerings!
The screams and hysterics! Who should play this or that, who
should be largest on the programmes and posters, who should
stand in the limelight, who should take the call—they never
quarrelled who should take the bird: that’s the hiss in our
lingo. They were always hissing at one another, or at the poor
manager, that’s me! I’ve seen the leading man and the leading
lady take their call hand in hand, and the moment the curtain
was down resume spitting fire at each other. It wasn’t that
they had any vanity, they said, it was only that their position
demanded they should take calls singly or be printed larger than
each other. Cocks and catamarans! I tell you if I hadn’t
swopped with Duke for his marionettes, I should have had little
rose-bushes growing out of me now, and that favourable stone
notice over me. Oh, the peace of it—it’s Sunday all the week!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see marionettes would be easier to manage,” said Will,
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but to feel it as I do, you must have lived through it.”
Mr. Flippance rose in his emotion and paced animatedly. “You
must have had a hornets’ nest for your seat and a brood of vipers
in your bosom, and shared diggings with the Furies. Oh, my
radiant juvenile, your sun-coloured hair would have been snow
if you had gone through what I have! If you’d had Ophelia in
hysterics and Hamlet in liquor and even the ghost hardly able
to walk, and the call-boy crying the curtain was up, and the
audience stamping and whistling, and short-tempered people at
the box-office demanding their money back, you’d be able to
measure the feeling of thankfulness that comes over the cockles
of my heart when I stand in my theatre and see my leading lady
sitting so angelic on her wires unable to move hand or foot
without me, or when I jerk my leading man out of the centre of
the stage all in a heavenly calm; And to see the curtain come
up and down with nobody scuffling behind it to bob and smirk—oh,
the Jerusalem restfulness! There mayn’t be as much rhino
in marionettes as in flesh and blood——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You just said there was more,” Will reminded him, unkindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant compared with the capital put in,” said Tony,
without turning a hair. “You don’t risk much when you don’t
have to pay your actors. But Duke wasn’t mercenary, and it
was the glory that appealed to him, poor man. He’d inherited
the business, like me, but he’d always been ambitious after high
art, he told me, and Flippance’s Fit-Up was his boyhood’s
dream. We did the swop over mulled claret last Christmas Eve
in this very inn. Peace and goodwill, thinks I, as we clinked
tumblers on the deal. You’ve got the goodwill, but peace, no,
that you’ll never see again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will smiled. “I’ll really have to come and see those blessèd
puppets,” he said, as the Showman replenished the glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony replied that he should see the whole boiling of them
either before or after the show, neatly packed in their big box.
“And if there’s any you’d like to kick, you’re welcome,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Damage your property?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would work off my bitter memories.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they’re not the real live actors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—there’s the pity!” said Tony. “But they look so
real—they’re life-size, you know—that I sometimes yell at ’em
and abuse ’em just for the satisfaction of their not answering
back. And the leading lady looks as if she had a tongue to her—I
promise you. A tongue—but thank the Lord it can only talk
Shakespeare or noble sentiments—can’t even nag the management
for a new dress. As for the juvenile lead, I can’t help
tweaking his nose sometimes for the sake of auld lang syne.
Polly can’t understand my spoiling his beauty—I can’t make
her see I’m getting a bit of my own back—and when she catches
me punching the low comedian’s head with a boxing-glove she
saucers her eyes, as though I was going dotty. But she never
had to manage ’em. And I had to travel ’em too—don’t forget
that. Fancy carting around a menagerie, all in the same cage!
But I have my revenge when I travel ’em now—into the box
they go—leads below and the heavy man sitting on their heads,
ha, ha, ha!—and utilities and supers on top of all! And it
don’t raise a whisper. Talk of the lion lying down with the
lamb. Believe me, old cock, that there millennium will never
come till we’re all on wires.” He drew vigorously at the cigar
his eloquence had all but extinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a lot of the brutes,” he mused between the puffs,
“that don’t know Tony Flip’s escaped out of hell, and they
write and call for engagements—same as Polly thought you did—and
if it isn’t Sunday I take ’em to see my company and rub
their noses into ’em, so to speak. Look at ’em, I say, every man
and woman knowing their place, and when to speak and when
to hold their blooming tongue, every one knowing their parts
too, which is more than you ever did, I’ll be bound. No wigs, no
make-ups, no dresses, no young bloods or decrepit dandies
coming behind, no prompter, nobody missing their cue, or
unpunctual or hysterical. No Bardell <span class='it'>versus</span> Pickwick. Nobody
drunk, married, divorced, deceased, laid up, locked up, or run
over, between the dress rehearsal and the first night. No
understudies, eating their heads off: in the way when they’re
not wanted, and missing their cues when they are. No sore
throats, no funerals to go to, no babies to get—if there’s a baby
wanted, I order it from the makers. And above all, my boy,
say I to ’em, no treasury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” inquired Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that? Well I’m blowed. That’s pay-day. And
kindly note, I say to ’em, that lead don’t get more than utility,
nor responsibles than walking gentlemen. It’s Owenism, you
sons of Mammon, I tell ’em, sheer Owenism. Everybody getting
the same nothing, and nobody coming carneying for advance
half-crowns. As for curtain-calls, the singing chambermaid’s
got the same chance as Lady Macbeth. And when it is a
leading man that’s come for a berth, I take him to the front of
the booth where there’s a retired village idiot I picked up,
banging the drum. Look there, says I, he’s not got much brains
but he isn’t wood, and that’s the only flesh-and-blood job I’ve
got left in this blooming shop. If you like to take it, why, in recognition
of your position, I’ll throw in an extra naphtha flare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do they say?” laughed Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t be repeated on a Sunday! But you can picture ’em
black in the face—all except the nose. That gets redder than
ever! Hullo, Charley! Come in! Come in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the open door he had caught sight of the landlord in
the corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t stop, Tony.” Mr. Mott was, in fact, hurrying to take
advantage of his spouse’s return to chapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gander-pecked again, I suppose,” laughed the Showman.
“Ah, Charley, you’d be much happier if you had a wife on
wires.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you go again!” And Mr. Mott, eager to join old
pals at their fishing, sniggered past, leaving a reek of hair-oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor chap!” sighed Tony. “But there’s always hope for a
man whose wife won’t call in a doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will laughed, and cunningly took advantage of all this expansive
geniality to escape from the room and the threatened
transaction and to call from the doorstep as he took his farewell,
“Then it’s settled—<span class='it'>I</span> get the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you bring it into the partnership,” cried Tony after him,
“not otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will found himself waylaid by Polly as he passed her doorway.
She beckoned him within with a mysterious, masterful forefinger,
and he, seeing the moreen curtains of her four-poster discreetly
drawn, entered, though not without Puritan misgivings. She drew
another curtain over the closed door communicating with her
father’s room, and turned the key. “Don’t waste my cigar,” she
said as he held it behind him. “I can see pa’s given you one of
mine.” And taking up her glowing fag-end from the ash-tray,
she resumed her suction of it, sipping in the intervals at a glass
of milk. “I suppose you won’t share my drink,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you,” he said, hardly believing his eyes, though he
now understood whence came the clouds in which he had found
her mantled. Perhaps she was really a man in disguise, despite
her long ear-rings. But then, would ever a male take milk with
his cigar? What with tobacco and horsiness, what was the sex
coming to? And yet there seemed something symbolic in this
combination of stimulants, this masculinity mitigated by milk!
“What do you want to say to me?” he asked, keeping the
front door open with his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this about a partnership?” she said softly. “I
couldn’t help hearing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ask me,” said Will in tones hushed as cautiously.
“Mr. Flippance did speak of it, but I’ve never thought of the
theatre as a business, only as a spree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he want you to take a theatre?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens, no! He called it hell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Flippance smiled sadly. “That’s his way of consoling
himself. He’s dying to get a stock company again. But he
<span class='it'>mustn’t</span> have even a theatre for amateurs. I’d fight it tooth
and nail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s bad for him, I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s bad for <span class='it'>me</span>,” said Miss Flippance. She puffed out a
cloud. “You see, there’d be no place for me. I can wipe most
actresses off the stage, but I’m not pretty—at least, not since
my illness—and the public won’t have me—except at the piano
where I turn my back on them. Plain actresses must be heard
and not seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Will was taken aback by such candour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, one of the women would probably entangle him into
marriage. I don’t mind his having a wife on wires!” And a
smile came travelling over the pits of her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean to say he really wants to go back to hell?”
said Will, dazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t the moths after you’ve saved ’em from the lamp?
And it was no easy task saving him. Christmas after Christmas
I used to jest: ‘Peace and goodwill indeed! You’ll never have
peace till you’ve got rid of your goodwill.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s what he says himself,” said Will naïvely. “So
he can’t be craving to go back—it’s the marionettes he wanted
me to stand in with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all my eye. He don’t know how happy he really is
nowadays, playing all the men’s parts. That was always the
trouble in a real theatre, especially when he was cock-of-the-walk—he
never could make up his mind which part he wanted. First
he’d try one, and then think another was better and throw it
up in the middle and take away the other man’s part. Nobody
likes to give up a half-digested part, and it doesn’t make things
easier when, after all, you get it back again. Imagine the
ructions he was always making, and I’m not going to have it all
over again. He’s got <span class='it'>all</span> the parts now, and so it’s going to
stay.” With which ultimatum she held out her hand and
gripped him with what he felt a manly clasp, and an honest.
“Don’t you be his partner,” she counselled. “He’s lost all his
own money and it’s not likely he’d multiply yours. He might
have been a big London actor or manager, but the Bible sized
him up before he was born. ‘Unstable as water, thou shalt not
excel.’ If only at least one can <span class='it'>keep</span> him to water! No, you
stick to your cash. There’s no money in the show for more than
him and me—my last jewellery will have to go for the horse—and
if you’ve really got the dollars, he’d have a theatre, with
you as juvenile lead, before you could say Jack Robinson, and
then he’d steal your part and drive you to drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will replied firmly, still holding her hand, that he was going
to put his money into farming, and by the way, would she
countermand that order to the Carrier for the horse?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but we must have a horse,” said Polly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so, but why through Jinny?” He was prepared
himself, he explained, to get them the best animal at the lowest
price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for what commission?” she queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For love!” said Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly withdrew her hand. “No, thank you. We’d best let it
go through Jinny—like everything else.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was the shepherd-cowman, and not Jinny, who delivered the
horn to Will. She had “happened of him,” Master Peartree
explained tediously, in the remote field to which he had taken
the sheep to feed off the winter barley. “Powerfully trumpeting”
for him with it just when he was looking for fly, when indeed
in the very act of discovering a maggoty rump, she had besought
him to convey that “liddle ole horn,” she being so late and
Gran’fer likely to be “in a taking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this “liddle ole horn”—when Will saw Master Peartree
and his sheep-dog coming along in the evening light—he took to
be the shepherd’s crook or his great umbrella folded, so lengthy
did it loom, and when he perceived that it was what he was
expected to perform on, he was taken aback. It was not that
he had not seen coach-horns in plenty, but he had seen them in
their proper environment and at their proper altitude, their
elemental straightforwardness making an exhilarating right-angle
with the guard’s mouth, a sort of streaming pennon. But a
coach-horn in its bare quiddity, quite as tall as the shrunken old
shepherd, and hardly a foot shorter than Will himself, dissociated
from jovial visions of scarlet, rum-soused visages and spanking
steeds, was as ungainly to behold and as awkward to handle as
it was difficult to explain away. Evidently the jade had bought
him the largest size on the market; he knew not whether to be
flattered or vexed at her idea of the appropriately virile. But
to send it by this alien hand—to make a village wonder and
scandal of it! How, indeed, was he to explain to the bucolic
mind his sudden passion for the instrument? Flutes and concertinas
folks could understand, even tin whistles; but what
could a man looking round for a farm want with a colossal
coach-horn? He was glad at least he had met Master Peartree
out of sight of his parents. There was a note attached to the
case, and he opened it the more eagerly that it delayed the
explanation which Master Peartree seemed to his morbid vision
to be grimly awaiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P.S.—The mouthpiece unscrews being mutable, so I can
exchange it for another, if this does not suit Mr. William
Flynt’s lips.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>How the deuce was he to play a polka he had never heard,
especially “with concinnity” (whatever that might be), was the
dominant thought in his perturbed brain. But as Master
Peartree seemed still expectant—was it even of a tune?—Will
stooped down to pat the dog, whose black-tipped tail was hoisted
like a friendly signal. It was a ragged animal just between two
coats—a canine counterpart of its shabby, straggly-haired master—but
Will caressed it like a velvety lapdog while he inquired
carelessly—his horn tucked like a telescope under his arm—how
the Carrier had carried herself, what exactly she had said. But
he only provoked—after the briefest glimpse of the girl—a
rambling narrative about a sheep that had broken its arm in a
“roosh,” in the panicky restlessness of the thundery Sunday: it
had fallen down a steep and another had rolled on top of it.
And even with this “meldoo” the sheep were so pernickety you
could do naught with ’em. Doubtless in this cloudy heat they
felt the weight of their wool—he should be shearing some for
the early market as soon as they could get the labour, which was
not easy in these migrating days. Even young men who came
back lazed about, he added pointedly, when they might be
earning good money. Will hastened to inquire whether the
shearers were as merry at their work as he remembered them.
He could never forget the beautiful bass voice of Master Peartree,
but he supposed time had now abated its resonancy, or was he
mistaken? He <span class='it'>was</span> mistaken, he admiringly admitted, for the
ancient was soon quavering out in a piping voice:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and Will, beating time with the great horn, was solemnly singing
the chorus:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>“<span class='it'>Chrissimus Day, Chrissimus Day</span>”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And now would the famous singer oblige with the “Buy a Broom
Polka”? Alas, he did not know it, with or without “concinnity”!
But young Ravens might know it, he who was as
full of tunes as a dog of fleas, and with his perpetual flow of
melody made bread and tea like harvest suppers, and shearing
days as jolly as Chrissimus. But where was this musical box?
Alas! he had “gone furrin,” being somewhere beyond Southend.
But master expected him back for the shearing; he was a
rolling stone, was Ravens, but he usually rolled back this time
o’ year. No, not rolled with liquor, nor yet like the sheep that
broke its arm. Had it been a fat sheep, he would have butchered
it, but as it was only store he had set the arm himself. No, he had
no need of a vet. for that, like the degenerate young shepherds
nowadays; he wouldn’t be beholden to cattle-doctors, not he,
keeping for ever o’ salts and gentians and bottles of lotion in his
hut, although “suspicioning shab”—it might even be rot from
the river-marsh—in one of the sheep which he had just been
examining for fly, he had taken the opportunity to ask Jinny to
send round Elijah Skindle. ’Tis a long talk that has no turning,
and Will, when the narrative thus came, by a wide detour, back
to Jinny, ceased fidgeting with the horn, and demanded what
she had said to that. It transpired that she had refused to order
Elijah, despite that Mrs. Flynt had recommended him as cheaper,
alleging, drat her, that Jorrow was the better man. Will,
curiously forgetting Mr. Flippance and his horse, concurred in
the view that carriers cannot be choosers. He also started
another current of indignation against carriers getting other
folks to fetch and carry for them. Would the hard-working
shepherd, who was too easily put upon, kindly not encourage the
girl in future to shirk her job?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Touched by the sense of his own magnanimity and the sixpence
slipped into his palm, the good shepherd promised to repress his
obligingness in the interests of the higher ethics, and Will,
bidding him farewell, slipped behind the row of stag-headed
poplars opposite the gate of Frog Farm, and strove—before entering
the house—to adjust his horn down his trousers and up his back.
It was no easy process with such a “protracted” object: fortunately
it was thin, save at the swelling end, but by keeping
this bulge below, he could avoid humping his back. To walk
with such a ramrod up it and adown one leg would, however,
have taxed the talents of the most graceful damsel training for
deportment. He hobbled painfully to the rear of the farmhouse,
designing to hide the horn before entering, but lo! there was
his mother filling the food-pot of his neglected ferrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my poor Will!” she exclaimed. “I told your father
you’d have rheumatics—sitting in chapel in your damp clothes.”
She tried to take him pitifully in her arms but he limped away,
fearing she would imagine his backbone had come outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only one leg a bit stiff,” he said ungraciously. But she
hooked her arm in his and drew her halt offspring towards the
back door; a brief but parlous journey, for he felt the horn
slipping towards his boot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, your ankle’s swollen,” said Martha tragically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll soon go down,” he assured her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A terrible struggle agitated the maternal heart. Even Will,
preoccupied with his grotesque position, could see her face
working.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure you wouldn’t like to have the doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, mother. What nonsense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her clouds lifted a little. “But this may be Jinny’s evening
for coming—I could tell her to go for him to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow it’ll be better—I feel certain, mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She beamed. “I’m so glad you’ve found faith, dearie. I
knew when once you began studying the texts you couldn’t miss
it. King Asa, too, suffered from his feet. But he sought to the
physicians and displeased the Lord. Have no confidence in man,
dearie. There’s days I get pains in my side as if my ribs grated
together. But I’d be afraid to put myself out of the Lord’s
hands, after I’ve trusted to Him all these years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will winced. He seemed to himself vaguely blasphemous. As
soon as he was alone in his bedroom, the swelling was transferred
to the capacious box so miraculously carried from Chipstone.
He dared not descend to supper: so speedy a miracle might
have seemed <span class='it'>too</span> “Peculiar.” But next morning (after a family
breakfast which was for his elders a veritable feast of faith) he
stole out with the horn and his fishing-rod and creel to the river,
which in the watches of the night he had decided upon as the
loneliest spot for practising, while the open ramshackle boat-house,
where the rusty punt usually nested, was to afford a
hiding-place for the instrument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was worth while going down that pastoral slope these days,
even were one not bent on music, solitude, and the winning of
gloves. In weather so prematurely sultry, the river was so
sweet and still and green, with its shadowy reflections, its blobs
of duckweed, the sedges and flags along its banks, and the
willows—grey-white or silvery—along its borders: gliding so
tranquilly in its reaches and lapping so lazily round its islands
that only at bends did the water seem to flow at all. In the
undulating meadows that sloped to it, silted with cow-droppings,
Master Peartree’s kine lay around chewing, and the sense of
brooding heat gave to the landscape a dreamy magic, suffused
with a sense of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to this idyllic retreat that our Tityrus or Corydon
repaired to essay his metallic pipe. And, standing on the bank
like a watchman, his horn to his lips, “Tucker, tucker,” he
breathed industriously into the unresponsive instrument. In
vain did he lip and tongue the notes as instructed, nothing broke
the sultry silence. Surely the mouthpiece could <span class='it'>not</span> suit Mr.
William Flynt’s lips. Suddenly, in his shamed impotence, he
had a sense of a breathing presence. In his agitation the horn
slipped from his nervous fingers and went souse into the water,
while the startled beast—for the observer proved to be only one
of Master Peartree’s cows—lumbered bouncingly back along the
pasture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately the instrument had lodged in the shallow mud of
the bank. Fishing it up—it was his sole catch that week—he
found to his joy that it emitted a faint toot, and he rightly
divined that a little water was just what it had needed. Encouraged
by this intervention of Providence in his favour, his
performance bore henceforwards some proportion to his pains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was embarrassing though to return from these painful puffings
without a single bite. Every dinner-time he had to sneak in as
best he could with empty basket after a morning of pertinacious
tooting, successful enough to frighten off the deafest fish. Once,
indeed, going home by a somewhat roundabout route that
skirted Blackwater Hall, he chanced on a Chipstone fishmonger
serving Long Bradmarsh, and was able to take home some fruits
of his rod. But the only time our piscatorial swain ever tried
for an honest bite was when he saw or heard somebody or something
coming along. Then, drawing in his horn like a snail, he
presented the picture of the complete angler. Usually it was
only Bidlake’s barge that disturbed his strenuous solitude, and the
transient mockery of the twins was for the futile fisher, not for
the unsuspected musician. Not even Master Peartree’s cows
ever munched their way again to the bank while the horn was
at its fell exercises, for, like the horn which the fairy Logistilla
presented to Astolpho in “Orlando Furioso,” its blast seemed
to put all creation to flight. His sole auditors were a pair of
swans who refused to quit their normal haunt, though they
hissed him fiercely. Possibly they were accustomed “to hear
old Triton blow his wreathèd horn,” and so had a standard of
musical taste. Is not the swan’s own song, too, celebrated,
though it appears only to perform before it dies, as if to evade
criticism?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But however soundly the swans might hiss, Will, after three
days of red-faced rehearsal on the pleasant bank of the Brad, felt
ready to challenge his female critic in all save the polka she had
set for examination, and this he determined—after failing to hunt
it out—was no fair part of the wager. A whole evening he had
spent reknitting the thread of old acquaintanceship with carolling
cottagers, gleaning much gratitude for his kindly attentions, but
not the melody he was after, and being forced politely to abide
while gaffers piped “Heave away, my Johnny,” or gammers
ruthlessly completed “Midsummer Fair” or “Dashing away
with the Smoothing Iron.” However, he could now turn out
such complicated military flourishes that he excited his own
military ardour, and felt like marching in his thousands, and
doing such deeds of derring-do that the lips of all the damsels of
Essex would vie to change places with that mouthpiece. It was
high time then that this particular damsel should understand
how vain was her hope that he could be baffled by a tube.
Though he might not know that polka, he was sure that whatever
“concinnity” might be, he could perform with it, and impatience
began to steal over him at the delay in the test performance.
For if Jinny had fobbed him off with the shepherd on Tuesday,
she evaded service altogether on Friday. Even Nip might
conceivably crop up with some small groceries tied on to
him, and he could not try it on the dog. Also, unless he saw
her soon, the cattle fair would be upon them, and she still unsaved.
He must, with the relics of his copybook paper, compose a new
note, formally citing her to stand and hear, and deliver the
gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not easy to fix the place for deciding the wager.
The riverside meadows she could not well get at in her cart, and
for her to come specially on foot was hardly to be expected, in
view of her household labours. To cut her off and perform to
her on a high road was to run risks of being publicly ridiculous:
even by-ways have ears. Suppose his nerve or his breath failed,
suppose some impish accident muffled up the horn: there would
he be with swollen cheeks, a mountain in labour, producing not
even, a mouse-squeak; the mock of man and beast. But there
was Steeples Wood—not too far back off the high road, but
approached by a tangly brake that few ever penetrated: there—if
he could persuade her to it—was the ideal place for the great
horn solo. In a postscript he would express his willingness to
take off her hands the purchase of the Showman’s horse. To
convey all this by correspondence involved almost as much effort
as the practising, though his renewed call upon the Bible came
to Caleb and Martha as the natural sequel of his faith-cure. It
was no small feat of composition, this particular letter, in face
of a people, which, however abundant its horses, appeared to
have had neither “wagers” upon them, nor “gloves,” riding or
other.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>That gloves were unknown to the ancient Hebrews, Will could
hardly bring himself to believe, even by hours of searching,
especially after coming upon a Fashion Catalogue for Ladies,
which showed a surprising wardrobe. Bonnets they had, it
would appear, and headbands and tablets and changeable suits
of apparel, and mantles and wimples and crisping pins and
fine linen and hoods and vails, and mufflers and girdles and
stomachers: as for their jewel-cases, they seemed stuffed not
only with rings and ear-rings and charms and bracelets and
moony tires, but likewise with jewels that dangled at the nose or
tinkled at the feet. How then should so elegant a world have
dispensed with gloves? But so—after scouring the sacred Book
from Genesis to Revelation—he must finally fain believe. Not
a single patriarch, priest, satrap, shepherd, physician, apostle,
publican, or sinner had ever sported gloves, and the Queen of
Sheba fared no better in this respect than the Witch of Endor.
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed with even one of these.
The Pharisees, it would appear, covered their foreheads with
phylacteries—whatever these might be—but left their hands
bare. And yet, Will thought wistfully, reading so early in the
sacred Book how Rebekah “put the skins of the kids of the
goats upon Jacob’s hands,” they might surely in all those
centuries have gone on to the idea of gloves, especially for winter
wear. But no, thousands of years after Rebekah, the knuckles
of Dives were apparently as raw as those of Lazarus. Oh, why
had he not betted something Biblical—a muffler now would have
suited either sex: even handkerchiefs were available. Not that
he could not risk spelling “gloves” to accord with “loves,”
which he found with no great difficulty in the holy text: he felt
it romantic to throw himself thus trustfully upon “love,” even
should it prove misleading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the search was not altogether vain, for though he could
find no gloves, the prophets, he found, were full of exhortations
to Jinny, which he carefully dog-eared and committed to memory
and kept up his sleeve for contingencies. “How canst thou
contend with horses?” Jeremiah asked her. Ezekiel warned
her against the cattle-dealer. “By reason of the abundance of
his horses their dust shall cover thee.” As for Isaiah, he remarked
plumply: “Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of
vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To himself, on the other hand, the prophets were kind;
abounding in promises for the prosperity of his horn. And it
was Amos who supplied his letter with its opening sentence,
abrupt but dramatic:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can two walk together except they be agreed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the letter written, there was the problem of sending it.
The intervention of either Bundock or Daniel was intolerable.
He must find an individual way. One verse that he came upon—it
was in the Book of Esther—enchanted him with its images,
telling how Mordecai wrote an order in the King’s name “and
sealed it with the King’s ring and sent letters by post on horseback,
riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries.” How
he would have liked to seal his letter too with a royal ring, and
send it “by post on horseback.” He had a vision of the long
procession of mules, camels, and dromedaries filing along the
grass-grown lane to Blackwater Hall. How old Daniel would
rub his eyes at the strange humped beasts—yes, and Jinny too.
She would perhaps think that Mr. Flippance had acquired a new
show and was paying her a processional visit. Possibly these
animal images did lead him to the invention of his postal method,
or possibly it was his prior apprehension of Jinny’s utilizing Nip
as a package-bearer. At any rate, after having wondered
whether Martha’s pigeons could be trained up in the way they
should go, he hit on the device of tying his note to Nip’s collar.
The creature was friendly, and that Saturday afternoon it would
be at home. He would only have to hover long enough around
Blackwater Hall for his post-dog to fawn upon him. Of course
there was no certainty the dangling missive would escape Daniel’s
spectacles, but Nip being providentially of the colour of paper,
it was possible heaven had not blanched him in vain. Besides,
this time the note was carefully addressed to Miss Jinny Quarles,
with the “Quarles” scratched out by an afterthought when he
remembered that it was not her name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, alas! Nip did not play up; that longed-for quadruped did
not appear in the purlieus of the Hall. Will, tired of carrying
about the note, thought again of sticking it up in the stable and
ventured near, but his fear of encountering Daniel Quarles was too
lively, and finally he essayed—with some obscure remembrance of
Bowery melodrama—to fix it gleamingly in the fork of a tree
by which Methusalem stood when harnessing and unharnessing.
To his amaze a chaffinch flew out of the fork in violent protest,
while her gaily coloured consort dashed up from another quarter,
crying “U-whit” at him like an avine Flippance. Peeping into
the hollow of the fork he saw a couple of rather belated youngsters,
ugly, bald-headed, and featherless, apparently new-hatched and
almost savouring of the egg: yet when he touched them with
the note, opening great eyes and yawning with yellow beaks and
kicking each other with skeleton legs. But before he could
bethink himself of a new posting-place, lo! as sudden as the
chaffinches but far more welcome, with a yelp of joy and a
perpendicular tail wagging like a mad pendulum, Nip was upon
him; and having succeeded with a desperate bound in licking
the tip of his stooping chin, rolled himself on mother-earth with
voluptuous grunts. Will profited by this supineness to attach
the note by the thread he had passed through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new postal system was a success. For when Will after
high tea sneaked out to the Common and sounded his horn—with
a happy combination of challenge, salute, and signal—Nip actually
appeared with a reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, however, unsatisfactory. Miss Boldero—the very
name, though he divined it denoted the same Jinny, came like
a glacial blast—presented her compliments to Mr. William Flynt,
but she had no time to be romantic in woods (she said) nor, even
at their homes, could she ever pay more than volant visits to
anybody, and that strictly in the way of Daniel Quarles’s business.
He could almost always find her at Blackwater Hall except
Tuesdays and Fridays, but she trusted he would not be too
turgid and thrasonical about his playing, even if his contumacious
serenade should be puissant enough to extort the pair of gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these strange words came, of course, from “The Universal
Spelling-Book.” Will, though he would still have refused to toot
before her grandfather, might have felt less crushed had he
known that in that ancient authority, “romantic” was defined
as “idle.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It is possible that persons of strict ethics—like Miss Gentry,
say—would have lost sympathy with Jinny in these epistolary
efforts of hers to stand on tiptoe, so to speak, and write beyond
her education. But in thus titivating her style with gems of
speech she knew not to be false, she was moved by the necessity
of countering an overweening, overbearing, interfering young
man, who was subtly assuming a sort of critical wardenship over
her and her life: he needed a good vibration (“<span class='it'>shaking</span> or
<span class='it'>beating</span>”), she must teach him by her gelidity (“<span class='it'>coldness</span>”) to
be less conversant (“<span class='it'>familiar</span>”), and that she was quite his
parallel (“<span class='it'>equal</span>”). He must be made to feel that her company
was not to be had for the rogation (“<span class='it'>asking</span>”), in short that she
was no housekeeping ignoramus to be ridden over by world-travelled
wisdom, however genuine. No, she was not going to
incurvate (“<span class='it'>bow or bend</span>”) to Mr. William Flynt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This rigidity was the more necessary as, ever since in that
thunderstorm his hand had tightened on hers—or was it the
reverse?—the lightnings seemed to pass through her, the reverberations
to shake her, whenever she thought of him, and even
when she did not. What there was in him to rend her thus
elementally she could not understand; doubtless it was the
memory of the storm now for ever associated with him. He
seemed—it was perhaps his life of adventure—to be in mystic
unison with tempests and floods and that sea-creek of her childhood,
now remembered exclusively as tossing and white-flecked.
Even when she was turning over her Spelling-Book to find words
to “vibrate” him with, it was the pages that vibrated: when
she copied its gelid trisyllables, she felt her hand again in his,
and her quill quivered as if the lightning were going through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even Miss Gentry, though she would have derided Jinny’s
new vocabulary, might have admitted that there was a laudable
side to her pursuit of learning: the Spelling-Book itself overflowed
with commendation of such scholastic zeal. Jinny no
longer knitted or sewed in her evening hour of leisure. It was
occupied—even after the concoction of the grandiose letter—in
a feverish study of the volume neglected since her first scholastic
period. She must make herself a greater intellectual power, she
felt: she must master all human knowledge. And that all
human knowledge lay in the hundred and fifty pages of this
little book, our simple village girl, who was not romantic in any
sense of that word, who, except for Bible and hymn-book, had
never read a book—not even a novel—and who approached life
with senses fresh and virginal, sincerely and crudely believed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was the pose of “The Universal Spelling-Book” calculated
to dissipate her delusion. This wonderful work, which was now
destined to become Jinny’s guide, philosopher, and friend, had
nothing in common with those shallow productions of a later
period, concerned mainly with correct combinations of letters.
Dating from the age of folios and exhibiting, despite its diminutive
size, the same solid solemnity, it did really take all knowledge
for its province. (You learnt, for example, how to make
the very ink you spelled with—and although you may rarely
have possessed those best blue galls of Aleppo which formed the
base of black, still you might hope to get the three pints of
stale beer that were the substratum of red.) And not only all
knowledge, but all morals formed the farrago of this book. Well
might it ostentate among its “Patronizers” clergymen, private
gentlemen, philomaths, writing masters, and heads of academies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Originally published—as already related—in the year of the
Lisbon Earthquake, and creating apparently as great a sensation
(in England at least), it constituted an <span class='it'>omnium gatherum</span> so
peculiar and extensive that there was no earthly (or heavenly)
subject you could be certain of not meeting there, though there
was one subject you could be certain of never escaping, for it
cropped up in the quaintest connexions—and that was Virtue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the author—who hailed oddly from the Royal Exchange
Assurance Office—justly claimed in his dedication to the Right
Honourable Slingsby Bethell, Esq., Lord Mayor of the City of
London, and One of its Representatives in Parliament (an
encourager of everything tending to “the Practice of Piety”
and “the Good of Mankind”), it was designed to do more than
barely teach the young idea how to spell. “To inculcate into
the Minds of Youth early Notices of Religion and Virtue, and to
point out to them their several Duties in the various Stages of
Life” was no less its aim. “And I should be very thankful,”
explained His Lordship’s obliged, obedient, and most humble
servant, “should I prove an instrument in the Hand of Providence
in preventing but one of the rising Generation from falling a
sacrifice to the pernicious Doctrines, secret Whispers, and
perpetual Insinuations of <span class='it'>Popish</span> Emissaries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a passage that had always swelled Jinny’s bosom with
emotion and the vow to ensure the gratification of this saintly
aspiration by supplying in herself the minimum one member of
the rising Generation to baffle these minions of the Scarlet
Woman. It had been at first a little bemusing to reflect that for
her Peculiar friends, the Established Church was little less
pernicious: still, fended by the double buffer of her sect and
Protestantism, she had thus far resisted the Emissaries she had
never encountered (for certainly the Rev. Mr. Fallow, whatever
the Chipstone curate might say of his Puseyite practices, had
never tried to pervert her even to the Establishment).</p>

<p class='pindent'>With three generations brought up on this pious pabulum—the
copy from which Sidrach the Owler had educated himself for
smuggling was already beyond the fiftieth edition—-it seemed
strange that the century should have had any declensions from
virtue to note; that papistry should have progressed was
incredible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If in her dim, childish way, Jinny had ever felt a jarring note
in this treasure-house of virtue and information, it was the
assumption that both these existed primarily for little boys.
True, among the fascinating woodcuts was one depicting little
girls at school, but even there the mistress occupied the stiff
chair, while the Dominie of the boys’ school, majestic in a full-bottomed
wig, sat throned on a chair with arms. “A good child
will love God,” she read with humid eyes, only to be pulled up
short by “he will put his whole trust in Him.” Everything
seemed to be masculine, from God downwards: there was no
place for women even in punishment: to be “well whipt at
School and at Home, Day and Night”—a recommendation she
found it difficult to reconcile with the definition of “Ferula,” as
“<span class='it'>a foolish Instrument, used in some Schools</span>”—was a Nemesis
held out only to the boy who minded not <span class='it'>his</span> Church, <span class='it'>his</span> School,
and <span class='it'>his</span> Book. Such a one would live and die a Slave, a Fool,
and a Dunce. But as to the fate of bad little girls there was a
mysterious silence. Even for their goodness there was no sure
reward: for though presumably they were included in the well-behaved
who would be clothed in Garments of Gold and have a
Crown of Gold set on their Head, while Angels rejoiced to see
them, these joys were never definitely attached to an exclusively
feminine pronoun. A virtuous “woman” appeared once to her
relief, but it was only to be a crown to her husband. Even in
the foot-notes Jinny could not find a female. “If the young
learner has learnt to read these lessons pretty perfectly,” said
one note, “let him go over them once more.” As for the Useful
Fables, it was the boy that stole Apples or went into the Water
instead of going to School; and when it came to the longest
story of all, “Life truly painted in the Natural History of Tommy
and Harry”—the story that professed to show “Youth the ways
of life in General,” and did indeed show how wickedness wrecks
you on the Coast of Barbary, where you are torn to pieces by
wild beasts as per woodcut, while the pattern of Virtue and
Goodness still lives happy—it appeared that even a realistic
picture of life may be complete without girls.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Behold, however, Jinny—despite her sex—embarked on a
learned career, and burning the midnight oil in her fat little lamp
instead of curling up in her chest of drawers. Puckering her
brow she sat on a squat wooden arm-chair in that dun papered
living-room, imbibing virtue and information, till the Dutch
clock in the outer box-room startled her with its emphatic
declaration of the hour, and the cracked mirror revealed eyes
heavy-lidded. Far out over the Common streamed the curtained
light of that midnight oil, for the shutter could not be closed,
owing to a pair of blackbirds that had set up house in the eaves.
Jinny had found one of the young fallen on the grass: she had
fed it with morsels of meat which it swallowed with great yellow
gulps, following up the meal with a fluted grace. She had
restored it to its nest—touched to mark the domestic virtue of
its co-incubating parents. It had grown quite big now and
flown hoppingly away with short sharp cries, but Jinny still
cherished the nest and felt no need of the barring shutter. In
the silence the creakings of the cottage often sounded like footsteps
outside, but Jinny was not nervous, and a real footstep
would rouse Nip, she knew. Sometimes, these warm May
nights, she heard the cuckoo keeping hours as late as hers, sometimes
the nightingales would sing passionately in the lane.
There was one, she knew, that niched in a mutilated, ivy-swathed
trunk bordering on the Common, and she would hear it answering
the faint melancholy calls from afar with throbs and gushes of
melody as well as with a series of quick, piercing notes. And
sometimes when the air was clear she could hear the distant
church clocks. But all these sounds, like Nip’s and the Gaffer’s
snoring, were but a restful accompaniment to the acquisition of
omniscience: even the nightingale, in her ignorance of literature,
failed to romanticize her thoughts, painfully bent on mastering
all there was to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanings, we have seen, played a great part in these studies:
“Dollar—<span class='it'>a Dutch coin</span>”; “Engineer—<span class='it'>an Artist</span>”; “Gambadoes—<span class='it'>a
Sort of Boots</span>”; “History—<span class='it'>an Account of Things</span>”;
“Interview—<span class='it'>Mutual Sight</span>”; “Logarithms—<span class='it'>Artificial Numbers</span>”;
“Mahomet—<span class='it'>the Turkish Impostor</span>”; “Replevin—<span class='it'>a
Writ so called</span>”; “Stolidity—<span class='it'>Foolishness</span>”; “Tarantula—<span class='it'>a
Baneful Insect</span>”; “Valentine—<span class='it'>a Romish Festival</span>”; “Upholsterer—<span class='it'>an
Undertaker</span>”; “Zodiac—<span class='it'>a Circle in the Heavens</span>”:
such were the strange vocables she kept muttering and misunderstanding:
believing indeed that “Paramour” was merely
a grander word for “<span class='it'>Lover</span>” and connecting divorce with
“Schismatic—<span class='it'>one guilty of unlawful separation</span>.” It pained her
to meet the “Sadducees—<span class='it'>a People that Denies the Being of
Angels</span>,” slurring, as did these unimaginable heretics, the status
of her own mother. Surely it was for such that “Damnation—<span class='it'>the
punishment of Hell Torments</span>” had been designed. Punctuation
too she studied, growing learned in Apostrophes, Asterisks,
Carets, Crotchets, and Obelisks; other hours were devoted to
Grammar, Tenses, Degrees of Comparison (always between good
and better <span class='it'>Boys</span>), Genitives, and even Scraps of Latin. Pronunciation,
however, was her great stumbling-block. How was it
possible to keep one’s feet in the chaos, say, of four-syllabled
words, each accented on a different syllable? Antiquary,
Ambassador, Affidavit, Animadvert—it was heart-breaking and
head-splitting. Her memory, so marvellous when vivified by
realities, broke down before this procession of shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With what relief she turned to the rich riot of “Moral and
Satyric Poems”—though her sex was still distressingly ignored,
and through every loophole the eternal male popped up.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Still, where “Swearing, Gaming, and Pride” were rebuked in
lashing lines, she was not sorry to find the petticoat conspicuous
by its absence. It was a rare joy to come on Queen Anne in a
“List of Abbreviations” under the unexpected guise of A.R.;
in the list of kings, too, she appeared again, together with Mary
and Elizabeth; not a large proportion, Jinny thought, rejoicing
at the Victoria unforeseen by the learned author, whose “Chronological
Account of Remarkable Things” stopped, like her friend
Commander Dap’s, at the Battle of Trafalgar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This table was indeed one of her favourite pages—it gave her,
she felt, a bird’s-eye view of all history—and with her head for
figures she never forgot that the Ten Commandments and the
Ten Plagues were given in 1494 <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span>, and that the sun stood still
at Joshua’s word in 1454, while Daniel was in the Den of Lions
in 536. She was puzzled, though, at the destruction of Troy
which intervened between Joshua’s interference with the sun and
Saul’s anointment. Of the twenty-two great events that preceded
the Christian era, this was the only one that the Bible
forbore to mention. Subsequently to Christianity things seemed
to her to have moved fast, for up till the year 1600 alone, fourteen
“remarkable Things” occurred—two-thirds as many as
had happened in the whole previous 4007 years since the world
was created—while after 1600, extraordinary events sprouted
like blackberries, no less than fifty crowding to their grand
climacteric in Trafalgar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these fifty she was glad to see included the Confutation of
Popery by Martin Luther—a personage with whom Miss Gentry
had made her familiar—and she thrilled almost with local pride
to find “Arts and Sciences first taught at Cambridge, 1119,” for
the Cambridge carriers sometimes penetrated eastwards as far as
Chipstone itself. As a carrier, indeed, she was immensely
excited by the “Eleven Days successive Snow” of 1674, the
“Frost for thirteen Weeks” of 1684, “The Terrible high Wind
of November 26, 1703,” “the great and total Eclipse of the
Sun, April 22, 1713,” and the “severe Frost for nine Weeks”
beginning on Christmas Eve, 1739. She could vividly sympathize
with the unfortunate carriers of those days, and she did not
wonder that these brumal phenomena should form so great a
proportion of the few score happenings of Universal History, for
frosts and winds must be terrible indeed to be recounted as on a
level with the shooting of Admiral Byng, the American Declaration
of Independence, the Birth of the Prince of Wales, and the
“Attempted Assassination of George III at Drury Lane by
Hadfield, a lunatic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These studious vigils were invariably wound up with a prayer
from this same limitless thesaurus: on her knees by the transmogrified
chest of drawers, and with her hair hanging down her
back, and the lamplight falling on the coarse grey-typed page of
the Spelling-Book, Jinny repeated one or other of its masculine
supplications, prose or verse, and only a cynic (“Cynic—<span class='it'>a Sour,
Crabbed Fellow</span>”) would have laughed at the solemnity with
which she swallowed all those motley lucubrations, whether lay
or clerical. An impromptu prayer for her grandfather was
invariably slipped in, for this holy book of hers finished as
terribly as the Old Testament, and what made it worse was that
this awful culmination of the Spelling-Book was printed in black-letter.
It was a gruesome recital of the miseries and follies of
“the Seven Stages of Life”—none of which seemed worth living
even with the correctest of spelling, while death seemed worth
dying to escape the depravity and decrepitude of the final
stadium. But although her grandfather, with all his peevish
humours, could hardly be counted so steeped in sin as the old
man of the text, while his infirmities were still rudimentary, yet
the physical prognostication was terrifying—“<span class='it'>for when we come
to those years, that our Eyes grow dim, Ears deaf, Visage pale, Hands
shaking, Knees trembling, and Feet faltering, then it is evident the
Dissolution of our mortal Tabernacle is near at Hand</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny could never read those dreadful words but she would
creep anxiously to the foot of the dark, twisting staircase and
listen for the reassuring sound of the Tabernacle snoring. And
if she bore so patiently with his whims and crotchets, not none of
the credit must be given to this sanctimonious Spelling-Book.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>While Jinny was thus pursuing omniscience and equipping
herself to meet the masterful young man, and while the young
man in question was adding the mastery of the horn to his
conquests, their roads failed to cross. Jinny went to chapel the
Sunday following the thunderstorm, but Will was too alarmed
by the communal expectation of public autobiography to venture
there again, and his parents were only too glad to ignore his
home-staying and to resume their private Christa-peculiar-delphian
service, being sufficiently fortified by his preoccupation
with the Bible. What had driven Will to the Book again was
the outrageous appearance on Saturday night of Uncle Lilliwhyte
as parcel-bearer. Recovering from his relief that the
parcel did not contain snakes, but the conventional household
stores, Will found himself angry on his mother’s behalf. What
right had Jinny to foist such a fusty ragamuffin upon them, the
gay strings of whose rotting beaver only accentuated his griminess?
Jinny must know that his mother ranked uncleanliness
next to ungodliness. And Uncle Lilliwhyte would be a fixture
too, unless violently shaken off—he was Jinny’s neighbour; as
natural a go-between as Will’s own neighbour, Master Peartree.
He had already bribed off the shepherd: must he be blackmailed
by both?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, while Essex was at prayer, Will was concocting a
furious Oriental epistle, demanding a clean envoy, if Jinny was
too lazy to come herself. This was not so difficult to demand,
though laziness seemed as unknown to the Hebrews as gloves.
He had dallied, indeed, with his original idea of fetching the
household parcels from Chipstone himself, but somehow he could
not bring himself to so complete a severance of relations with
Jinny, especially as after the appearance of Uncle Lilliwhyte in
the new rôle of goods-deliverer, his mother had surprisingly
suggested that to spare Methusalem’s legs, the old nondescript
might always in future bring the weekly parcel for a penny or
two. Will had put this suggestion emphatically aside—it would
mean exposing his mother to a contact she detested—but he
wound up his letter to Jinny by threatening to become his own
carrier unless the service was conducted with propriety. Nip
duly returned that same Sunday afternoon with the answer that
if he would send his esteemed order in writing, Mr. Daniel Quarles
would have pleasure in executing his commission through a
scrupulously scoured ambassador. Will started replying instantly
that it was not <span class='it'>his</span> order: let her mark that he was not
the householder, merely the “scribe.” To write out the order,
however, gave him unexpected pause. Who could have realized
that “parrafin,” “sope” and “shuggar” were alike unenjoyed
by the heathen Jews? A pity that Frog Farm was itself so
“flowing with milk and honey”: with what confidence he could
have drawn on the resources of Palestine! True, one might
dodge—lamps and oil were abundant enough in Judæa, and
purification and sweetness could be suggested with airy allusiveness.
But in the end he only wrote grandly, “Household order
the same as uzual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before this order had been executed, however, chance brought
about a meeting. Not that Miss Gentry, near whose wayside
cottage it occurred, would have called it chance. For that deft
needlewoman, besides believing in her own stained-glass miracle,
cherished, as we know, a naïve faith in “Culpeper’s Complete
Herbal”—a faith doubtless sustained by the attacks on the Pope
or on infidel physicians that might lurk snakelike in its most
innocent-seeming herb. Under the stimulus of this elementally
indelicate work—never permitted to stray from her bedside,
though imparted in filtered form to Jinny—she would tie woody
nightshade round her neck for her dizziness, and buy watercress
from Uncle Lilliwhyte to wash away pimples with the juice.
And if these herbs were, as Culpeper testified, under the respective
governance of Mercury and the Moon, how much more so human
life! Miss Gentry had indeed remarked to Will that very
afternoon (when he at last brought his mother’s bonnet to be
“bleached as good as new”) that her own horoscope, cast in
infancy by her aunt, had shown that the first time she went
upon a voyage she would be drowned: a reading whose infallibility
her happy survival demonstrated, since she had never been
foolish enough to set foot upon a vessel. “But for the deciphering
of this horoscope,” she had pointed out, “I should surely
now have been drowned, for I am naturally as fond of voyages
as you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be admitted that if Miss Gentry had thus pathetically
perished, Will would not have taken his mother’s bonnet to her,
nor met Jinny that afternoon. But then would he have met
Jinny but for the foolish sheep? Even the ovine fates, it would
appear, are interblent with the human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sheep suddenly dawned upon Jinny’s vision as Methusalem
with his cunning nose was trying to open a gate that led over a
private road, on either side of which its fellows grazed. Preoccupied
with the task of clasping Nip so that he should not
frighten the flock in his passage, she did not at first observe that
in the gap between the hinge of the gate and the post, a sheep’s
head was jammed, and that Methusalem’s success in lifting the
latch bade fair to asphyxiate it. The silly creature, having
escaped from the flock, had evidently tried to jump back again
through this gap, at a point just large enough to admit its head,
and with the failure of the leap, the head had descended into
the narrowest portion and there remained in pillory. In the
creature’s terror at the approach of the cart and Nip’s excited
barking, its efforts to free itself became more convulsive than
ever. Checking Methusalem in the middle of his pet trick, and
fastening up Nip, Jinny jumped down and with soothing words
seized the head of the frantic sheep, which was still thrusting itself
backward and forward, though without the sense to jump
upwards towards the broader space. But alas, its spasmodic
struggles prevented her from getting a sufficient grip on it to lift
the wedged and weighty head. She saw its ear was torn and
bleeding, and to her imagination it was going black in the face.
She looked round desperately. On the other side of the gate
lay the flock, scattered apathetically over the pasture they had
reaped and manured, chewing a tranquil cud, like self-righteous
citizens before the writhings of one of their own black sheep: of
a good Samaritan or shepherd there was no sign. She climbed
over the gate and strove to lift the agonizing head from the
other side, but she only increased the sufferer’s frenzy as well
as Nip’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be quiet, Nip!” she shouted, almost hysteric herself. And
as she raised her eyes to admonish the yapping terrier, she espied
to her joy a puffing pipe and a stick advancing towards her cart;
whether a young man or old she was not aware. He was simply
man as saviour, and he was at the gate and working at the rear
of the struggling head before she had quite realized it was Will,
and a certain added pleasure at the sight of this man in particular
had scarcely time to well up before it was swamped by the far
greater pleasure of seeing the sheep deftly released. It staggered,
however, as Will let it go, and lay sideways on the road, gasping,
and Jinny observed with horror a raw ring round its throat
where the wool was cut through as by a cord. But before she
could get through the gate to its assistance, it had risen feebly,
and as she came towards it, it trotted off timidly. Vastly
relieved, she tried to coax or chevy the truant back to its
companions. But it refused to go: on the contrary, it
retreated, and in solitary self-sufficiency began to crop the wayside
grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t spoiled her appetite!” said Will, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t seem to feel things as much as us,” agreed Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed.” He knocked the ashes out of his pipe and
pocketed it. “Fancy, if you’d got your head nipped like
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There seemed something aggressive in the suggestion. “<span class='it'>I</span>
should have known to lift it up without waiting for a man,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All very well, but when one’s head’s caught, one is apt to
lose it: one struggles blindly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not all like sheep to go astray,” she said uneasily.
“But thank you for your kind help.” She jumped up and drove
slowly through the gate. He closed it behind her and ran to
open the gate at the opposite end of the private road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you again,” she said, passing through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely you’ll come into the wood now you’re so near,”
he cried through the arch of the vanishing tilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cart unexpectedly slackened, Jinny’s head was turned
backwards. “If you won’t be long,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shut the gate briskly and kept pace with her slow progress
along the leafy lane towards the wood-path they both knew.
Nip, untied, sprang to fawn at his feet, and then bounded into
the hedge after something smelt, and barking raucously, wormed
his way along like a weasel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you come, Will?” said Jinny softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you?” he evaded. “Why did you send Uncle
Lilliwhyte?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t come because you didn’t,” she answered simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—your grandfather,” he stammered. “I couldn’t well
play before him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean you couldn’t play well,” she flashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all you know about it. I can blow better than Dick
Burrage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why be nervous of poor old Gran’fer? He might have
been umpire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was shocked again. “Good gracious, Jinny! Where did
you get those betting words from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my affair.” She pursed her pretty lips. “But never
mind—however you blow—you’ve deserved a pair of gloves
to-day—in sheepskin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “I’m not above taking two pairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you win!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I’ll win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t brag. Save your breath for your blowing. We shall
soon be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I’m not going to blow now,” he pointed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now? Then why have you lured me here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could I guess I should meet you? How could I
lure you? You could see I hadn’t got my horn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hadn’t noticed,” Jinny murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s big enough,” he said grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I certainly shan’t go into the wood. I’m much too
busy. Good-bye, Will.” She flicked her whip, but ere Methusalem
could quicken a leg, a terrible yelping came from the bushy
hedgerow—it was the voice of Nip, but not of Nip the hunter,
rather of a hunted, trapped Nip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, poor Nip!” And in a moment Jinny had leapt down
and was peering and pushing into the hedge. But she could
penetrate scarcely at all: the wood behind was firmly guarded
by a broad chaotic belt of thistle and nightshade, burr and
bramble, furze and stinging-nettle, a veritable riot of prickliness;
and this thorny tangle had closed upon Nip—trespassers prosecuted
indeed!—though it was a relief to his mistress to find the
trap was natural, not wickedly human. Stuck full of burrs, and
looking like a spotted pard, her pet was shrieking for first aid.
But even while she was hesitating to pierce farther, despite her
gloved hands, Will brushed by her, thrilling her with the sense
that this was his second feat of animal salvation; while the
woodland savours and the rich prodigality and ruin of nature—for
dead wood lay around as profusely as rank vegetation sprouted—seemed
to stir in her the same sense of elemental forces as the
thunderstorm. She scarcely noticed that Will had the aid of
his stick in parting the jungle, and when he restored the whining
animal to her arms, gratitude and hero-worship mingled in her
emotion, though for a moment she was too occupied in picking
Nip clean to say much, while Will, for his part, was engaged
with equal industry in removing thorns from his sleeves and
burrs from his trousers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’ve hurt yourself!” she said at last, catching sight
of blood and scratches on his hands and wrists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nothing.” He tried to pluck out something from a
finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I help you?” She pulled off her driving-gloves, took
his finger and squeezed at the flesh, perceiving the microscopic
protrusion of the thorn, but her own fingers were shaking and
she could not extract it. He said it did not matter, it would
work out; then he started sucking it. She somehow would have
liked as with a child to kiss the place and make it well—the
whole back of his left hand seemed reticulated in red—but
instead she carried Nip back to his basket in the cart. He, too,
was scored in red, though he did not seem to mind any more
than the sheep. As she bent over her scratched pet, Will came
up to the tail-board, still sucking at his finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall need gloves now,” he said, glancing with comic
ruefulness at his scratches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor hero!” she said, with eyes softly flashing. “I <span class='it'>will</span>
come into the wood and you shall win them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face lit up; then fell. “But how?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t there <span class='it'>my</span> horn, silly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed gleefully. “You’re right to call me that.” She
leaped down, the horn dangling at her girdle, and fastened
Methusalem to a tree. “Not that he’s likely to move: still his
head <span class='it'>is</span> homewards.” Methusalem’s head, however, was already
grasswards: he was munching with gusto, while his great tail
swished at the flies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But suppose somebody steals the parcels!” said Will with
sudden compunction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t Babylon—or America,” said Jinny witheringly.
“Besides, there’s Nip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only a few yards farther was the opening they had been
making for, but they now found it almost as overgrown as the
entry chosen by Nip, and had it not been for the rare fern-leaf
elders in the hedge, that marked their memory of the spot, they
might have passed it by. “Might be in Canada,” said Will.
However, he pioneered with his stick, and, following him closely,
she had a sense of safety and protection unknown since the days
she was escorted from chapel. It was quite strange—yet not
unsweet—to be thus guarded from the venomous vegetation
thrusting at her from all sides, and she was not sure she was
relieved when the menace and novelty were over, and they were
in the wood. The struggle, moreover, had made the humanized
part of the wood, on which they emerged, somewhat tame. The
grove of young ash, beautiful as the slim silver-grey trunks were
with their new green livery—too light to cast a shadow—suggested
commerce to both of them, and the suggestion was
emphasized by the charred remains of a bonfire of elm-loppings,
and by a deserted charcoal-burner’s hut in a clearing. But
poetry had gathered on the mossy stumps of other trees, long
since felled, and they came down a wonderful azure river of
bluebells running as between wooded green banks. As they
waded through the tall thin stalks, they chanced here on a patch
of late-lingering primroses and there on green advance waves of
foxgloves, with their long leaves. Primrose, bluebell, foxglove—what
a beautiful succession, thought Jinny. How marvellous
was earth in its changing loveliness, and Heaven in its unchanging
bounty! On another slope, crowned by Spanish chestnuts,
glittered a stream purling down to lose itself in scrub. Here
rosemary was in bloom, humming with bees, and yonder was
broom, its yellow blossoms showing against a lighter green than
the earlier gorse, which flowered in great golden clumps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gorse looks fine,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And smells finer,” said Will. “Let’s sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here,” said Jinny, coyly shrinking. “There’s nettles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re dead!” he said, grasping their yellow brittleness.
But they walked on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came over baby bracken and crisp beechnuts to a sort
of ring surrounded by blushing young oaks, and little silver
birches with their flat green leaves, and tall aspen-trees, and one
lonely mountain-ash with white flowers. Overhead, early as it
was, the moon had long been hanging at three-quarters, white
and magically diaphanous: a dream-planet. Unseen wood-pigeons
purred, and a tomtit was singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here!” said Will, beginning to sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!” She clutched his arm to keep him up. “An
ant-heap!” This time her shyness had found sounder cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a comical “Oh!” and stood watching the squirm of
seething life, absolutely black at the central congestion, where
ants walked indifferently under or over one another: they were
like the moving grains in an hour-glass, Jinny thought. Will
poked his stick into the great piazza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not hurting them.” The ants were, in fact, already
using the rod as a causeway. “Why, they’re like you, Jinny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All carriers and all busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, and followed their movements with a new
sympathy, though she was rather disgusted by those that carried
dead flies or dead ants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are not carriers—those are undertakers,” she insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down at last on a mound of spongy moss, free from
formic activity, and there was a silence. The little purling
stream was too far off to break it, but they heard a chaffinch
and the peep-bo-playing cuckoo, with that golden human note
that floats through the warm, brooding May. And then the
irrepressible and unbasketable Nip came rushing and tearing,
not making straight for them, but appearing and disappearing
like a giant fungus in the rich masses of blues or greens or yellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made an opening for conversation, and presently when he
came snuggling into Jinny’s arms—poor scotched creature!—an
opportunity for joint patting and petting: a process in which
hands do not always succeed in partitioning out the pattable
and pettable surface rigidly, but graze and brush each other, and
even lie passively in abstracted contact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t I buy this wood?” said Will, after one of
these sustained manual juxtapositions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t that be lovely?” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I must settle something soon. Those aspens, though,
I’d cut ’em down. They’re only a weed. And yonder ashlings
weren’t planted quite close enough—you’ve got to make ’em
fight for air if you want ’em straight enough to sell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was vaguely disappointed at the turn of this conversation;
not following the romantic dream vaguely underlying it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But could you afford to buy such a big wood?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big wood? Why, in Canada you get forever of land for
nothing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why didn’t you stay there?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is better than America,” and his hand touched Jinny’s
too consciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what was the matter with America?” she murmured,
withdrawing the hand from Nip’s flank with a little blush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything was the matter with America, it appeared. He
was, indeed, more anxious to explain how nothing was the matter
with Essex, but under Jinny’s physical bashfulness and intellectual
curiosity he found himself headed off his native county
and kept closely to Transatlantic territory. And under the spell
of her eager attention he was soon discoursing fluently enough,
sketching a discreetly selected picture of his adventures, beginning
with the emigrant sailing packet in which he had gone out as
a stowaway, but wherein he fared little worse than the emigrants
proper, who in the first six of the thirty-seven days’ voyage had
had none of the stipulated provisions served out to them, despite
their contract tickets, and no meat during the whole voyage.
They had had to be satisfied with their daily water and the right
of cooking, and complaints were met with oaths from the officers
and doctors, and sometimes even with fists or rope-ends from
the sailors. Once or twice the hose had been turned on them,
but there were over nine hundred of them, he said, so she might
imagine the Babel and confusion, though there were two great
passenger decks on which the tallest man could stand, and on
whose shelved sides they could all find sleeping-space, with never
more than six to a berth. And then from the moment America
had burst upon the vessel in the guise of touts, runners, and
employers, all anxious to mislead or enslave, he had borne
through the continent the banner of a steady disapprobation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the States, where his first clutches at Fortune had been made,
peculiar perils awaited the British immigrant. If he gravitated,
as was natural, to the cliques and boarding-houses of his countrymen,
he was likely to be soon “used up” by the gambling and
drinking sets that feigned to make him welcome. And if he
escaped this pitfall by his resourcefulness, he would strike the
native American prejudice against English immigrants, popularly
supposed to consist of the paupers and wastrels whom the parish
overseers of Old England, anxious to be quit of the burden of
supporting them, bribed with free Atlantic passages and dumped
on the struggling New World: a prejudice, Will admitted laughingly,
which his own purse had done nothing to diminish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he had got a job as car-driver and fed at the market-houses,
but though the food was good and cheap, the company was
rough of manner and language. And even when he was earning
good money—at a boot-store with the sign of a gigantic boot
made of real leather reaching to the first-floor windows—he had
disliked the “go-along-steamboat” pressure of existence, and
the Mechanics’ Boarding House where gabbling Yankees gobbled
at a pace both unhealthy in itself and unchivalrous to the
unpunctual. The habit of loading the table with all the courses
simultaneously took off the edge of his appetite if he was early,
and left only universal ruins if he was late. He had no patience
with clams that were not oysters, egg-plants that were not eggs,
and corn that had to be munched cow-like. Accustomed to the
clean linen of the paternal farm, he loathed the insect-ridden
bedrooms one divided with a varying number of strangers. He
liked to see pigs, but not perambulating and scavenging the
streets; why, in New York they were more numerous than the
dogs! Providence had designed tobacco, he opined, for smoking
and not for chewing; and saliva for swallowing, not for spitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, in fact, a most unpleasant America that loomed up to
Jinny’s vision that day, especially in contrast with this lovely
wood, overbrooded by the white moon now growing faintly
golden: a sort of spittoon of a continent, mitigated by dollars
and dancing. Even in Canada, for which Will had felt a more
personal responsibility—accentuated by the British soldiers to
be met at every turn—and in which he gladly picked out points
of superiority to the States, a similar sense of massive untidiness
had weighed upon him and jarred every home-born instinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to convey to Jinny the desolation of zigzag rail-fences
that took the place of these hedges now glorious with hawthorn
and fool’s-parsley and the starry stitchwort; the raw settlements,
the half-built log huts hardly superior to yon derelict charcoal-burner’s
hut (their windows stuffed sometimes with old straw
hats), the unachieved roads, full of mud or dust, the ubiquitous
stumps that were once trees, the piles of logs that were not yet
habitations, all that crude civilization arising shoddily out of the
virgin forest on the sole principle of the cheapest practicable,
with nothing whole-hearted but the lust for dollars. Caleb
Flynt’s slow English conservatism, Caleb’s unworldly standards,
spoke again through his son. But even Will was too inarticulate
to put his feeling precisely into words—and when Jinny reminded
him that in this very wood trees had been cut down and burned,
and that he himself had spoken of cutting down the aspens, he
could not quite make clear to her, who had never known any
but long-humanized places, the peculiar indecency of a forest at
the stage of semi-transformation into a mushroom settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beautiful enough the backwoods, he laboured to explain, where
man’s fight with the forest was only begun, where great beeches
and maples, and wild flowers still possessed the black mould the
settler was to lay bare for wheat; where his pioneer hut was
circled by a green gloom, and the chink of his cow-bells or the
laughter of his children alone vied with the ring of the axe and
the thunderous fall of the giants. But later on—“it’s like that
plover’s egg you opened once,” he burst forth with a sudden
inspiration. “No longer an egg, not yet a bird; only a smell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was you who gave it me,” laughed Jinny. There was
a great content at her heart, sitting here and seeing her little
world open out in forests and seas and emotions still stranger.
And he—he for the first time enjoyed the society of woman as
spiritual counterpart, had moments in which he forgot Jinny was
pretty, in which her hand—now unconsciously nestling in his in
her absorption in his narration—was felt as a friendly rather
than as a physical glow. Unfortunately in this sense of a
sympathetic Jinny lay the serpentine temptation which shattered
their paradise. For, beguiled by her apparent subjugation, he
went on to improve the occasion. “And it’s just the same with
women who are neither women nor men. A woman’s place is
the home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slipping of Jinny’s hand out of his was the first sign that
he had roused her to reality. Her cry, “How late it is!” was
the next. And she looked at the sunset glowing in glamorous
gold through the trees. There was a magic peace in the air, and
a rare thrush sang as in a dream. It seemed a tragedy to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will protested vehemently. “It’s not late at all. You were
unusually early this afternoon. No, don’t go—you’ll wake up
poor Nip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did your story send him to sleep? Rude dog! But I must
go—a woman’s place is the home!” She got up, smiling, with
the snoring dog in her arms, but her mockery was friendly
enough: the intimate atmosphere could not be dissipated at a
jerk. He was constrained to follow her, if only to precede her
through that jungly path: the prospect of driving home with
her still shone rosy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” he said lightly, “I’ve been talking with Mr.
Flippance about getting that horse for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” She stopped and turned on him, her eyes blazing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His last animal was faked,” he explained mildly. “He was
badly taken in, and you can’t know all the tricks of the trade as
well as a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And isn’t Mr. Flippance a man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course. But—but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all depends on which man, you see—and which woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m sure no woman knows properly about horses,” he
said. “How would you tell the age, for instance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the teeth, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which teeth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny flushed. She really did not know, and that made her
only angrier: “If I wanted your help in my affairs, I should
have asked you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s nothing to be mad about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is everything to be mad about. How did you know
he wanted me to get a horse? Only because I told you. And
then you go to him and interfere with my business and insinuate
I’m incapable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not so much you’re incapable——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s because a woman’s place isn’t the cattle-market, I know.
But why can’t we buy cows as well as butter, and horses as well as
horse-collars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because only men go—and it’s rough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then, let women go and it won’t be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you want women to be horsemen too, get up at four
o’clock and go ploughing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They haven’t the strength, for one thing. There’s lots of
things they can’t do, and never will. Take thatching, for
instance—you can’t imagine a woman sprawling along a roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course <span class='it'>you</span> can,” he sneered. “You can imagine her in
breeches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If petticoats get in the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll never be Bloomerites in England,” he said grimly.
“You mark my word. If a woman can’t plough or dig without
leggings, that’s a proof she wasn’t meant to plough or dig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached now the pleached and tangly path back to
the road, but she darted ahead of him, battling with the branches
herself in her revolt from dependence. He could not regain the
lead unless he jostled rudely, and every now and then—not
with wilful malice, but no less maddeningly—she held back for
him the boughs she had parted. And all the while the sleeping
Nip was protected too: clasped by one hand to her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the circle of her little horn got caught in the bushes
like the horn of Isaac’s ram. “Why, Jinny,” he cried, “we
forgot all about the horn! Wait! Wait!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She disentangled it calmly. “You shan’t blow mine. You
must blow your own now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fired up. “You want to get out of the gloves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’re going horn-mad,” she jested icily, emerging on
the high road. “Good-bye, Mr. Flynt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time she had withheld the Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Miss Boldero,” he said as frigidly, removing his
hat with an exaggerated gallantry. Each felt that the parting
was final: never would they even speak to each other again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they had yet to reckon with Nip. For that intelligent
creature, waking into the distressing atmosphere that had been
generated while his vigilance was relaxed, would be no party to
the breach. When he perceived that the cart was to go off
without Will, he jumped down and tried to chevy him into it,
and as the parties went off at a tangent, he ran desperately from
one to the other, striving to shepherd them together, barking
and pleading and panting like a toy engine. It was only a peremptory
blast from a distant horn that at last persuaded the
distracted animal where his first duty lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dying day still flooded the earth with warmth and
radiance: the little coffee-and-cream-coloured calves still frisked
in the meadows that the buttercups turned into fields of the
cloth of gold: the forget-me-nots were still gleaming in the
cottage gardens, the lilac was still peeping over manorial walls,
the laburnum still hanging down its yellow chandeliers, and the
horse-chestnut upholding its white candelabras. But for these
twain, obstinately and against the best canine advice going their
separate ways, the colour had been sucked out of the landscape
and the clemency from the air. Before Will, wandering deviously,
had remembered his evening sausages, these also had grown
cold; mist and clouds had turned the moon to a blood-red
boat, and the bats were swooping and the wood-owls shrilling
where larks had soared and sung.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is to be feared that the sting of Mr. Will Flynt’s offence lay
precisely in Jinny’s ignorance of horses, and that if her old
companion had come to her aid more tactfully, she would have
welcomed his co-operation in the great purchase. But her pride
in her work would hardly allow her to admit even to herself
that here was a commission perhaps beyond her capacities. Had
she not enjoyed an almost lifelong experience of Methusalem?
As a monogamist would resent being told he knew nothing of
matrimony, so Jinny repudiated the notion that she knew
nothing of equinity. Besides, the cattle-market was far from
seeming so strange a world to her as Will had imagined. Had
her cart not often conveyed thence or thither a netted calf, had
she not marketed even his own mother’s piglings? A fig for
the masculine aura! If Mr. Flippance exaggerated after his
fashion in declaring she would have undertaken to get him the
moon—at any rate it was not the man in it that would have
kept her back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, therefore, with a bruised and burning but indomitable
heart that Jinny went about her work these ever longer days. For
women must work, though men may mope. Poor Will, who had
nothing to do but to chew his bitter cud of memory, was the
more pitiable, and his temper was not improved when early
Friday evening the comparatively clean Master Gale, evidently
caught on his way home from school, arrived with “the same as
uzual.” This apple-cheeked and white-collared understudy for
Jinny was no less an eyesore than Uncle Lilliwhyte, and Will
made Martha refuse the parcel on the ground that if they encouraged
the lad, it would lead to truancy. Such was his
solicitude for the schoolboy whose copy-book he had diverted
from its scholastic function. But he was not less furious when
Farmer Gale brought back the parcel the next morning on horseback
and explained amiably that he had seen Jinny about it,
and that henceforward this overburdened damsel would leave
the Flynt parcel with his, and he would have pleasure in delivering
it in the course of riding about his farms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain and the cold snap, that had come so suddenly after
the quarrel in the wood, was welcome to Jinny in her present
mood. For her the summer was over. True, she espied its first
wild rose, but it reminded her only of a round strawberry water-ice,
such as her well-to-do clients spooned at the Chipstone
confectioner’s. Everything was gelid, except Nip’s nose, and that
but added to her depression. Was the darling feverish from the
scratches of his spiny crawlings, or did he share his mistress’s
heavy humours? Her distraction might have led to a nasty
accident had not the last of the trio kept his head, for in a lonely
lane Methusalem, who in these days seemed to whinny his
sympathy and nuzzle into her palm with enhanced tenderness,
deftly avoided the prostrate antlered trunk of an oak-tree which
had been split and splintered by lightning. Possibly it had lain
there since that Sunday’s storm, for her work had not brought
her that way. The bark of the whole tree had been peeled off,
save for a small patch where a few buds still suggested vitality,
and Jinny had a grandiose sense that all nature sympathized
with the strange desolation that had come over her joyous self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mind turned to fate and constellations as she drew up at
Miss Gentry’s door and summoned with a blast that fantastic
female, who was feeding the chickens with which she variegated
life and tantalized Squibs. Miss Gentry did not need anything
beyond her usual depilatory. It was a standing grief and
astonishment to her that though white lilies (under the domain
of the moon) will “trimly deck a blank place with hair,” neither
Culpeper nor the planets had provided against the contrary
contingency: even fig-wort (owned by Venus) merely removing
wens and freckles. Hence she was reduced to a mere chemist’s
prescription: a solution of barium sulphide swayed by no
known planet. The stuff came in a pot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry in ordering it did not shirk the word “depilatory.”
On the contrary she pronounced the five syllables with a pomposity
which was the more impressive to Jinny because even
“The Universal Spelling-Book” stopped short at four syllables.
Not for worlds—whether to her client or the public at large—would
Jinny have betrayed her knowledge that the hair-destroyer
represented a never-ending battle with Miss Gentry’s moustache.
And for the sensitive dressmaker herself the polysyllable was a
soothing cover. Ostrich-like she hid her head in its spacious
sandiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, however, the little matter of Martha’s bleached
and new-trimmed bonnet, which Jinny might convey to Frog
Farm, and the casual mention that it was Will who had brought
it led to considerable conversation. Jinny’s equipage was drawn
up outside the little garden, where tulips (red, damask, and pink)
stood like tall guards before a tropical palace; and Miss Gentry,
despite the chill wind, leaned on her garden-gate, carefully
nursing her black cat against Nip’s possible swoops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The excellent lady, whose erudition Jinny had always absorbed
with the reverence due to a reader of <span class='it'>The Englishwoman’s
Magazine</span>, was always delighted to have the girl sitting at her
feet—even though to the crude physical vision Jinny always
appeared to be sitting above her head, and Miss Gentry to be
looking up to her. Sometimes real information from the aforesaid
magazine, which bore the sub-title of “The Christian Mother’s
Miscellany,” was thus transmitted to Jinny; but Miss Gentry’s
brain was obviously too cluttered up with archaic notions to be
really beneficial to her young devotee. Thus, although Miss
Gentry enlarged Jinny’s mind, it was more a matter of range
than of accuracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation to-day, however, was on a more personal
plane. Jinny was resolved to speak no further word to Mr.
William Flynt: his interference was unforgivable. But when it
transpired that he had brought the bonnet, she did not attempt
to check Miss Gentry’s flow of favourable comment, still less to
contradict it. For a Peculiar he was quite the gentleman, Miss
Gentry opined, especially after that coarse and flippant Bundock.
Not tall enough for her taste, because she thought you ought
always to look up to a man; still, handsome in a rough way,
despite his ginger hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not ginger!” Jinny protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shades to ginger,” the dressmaker replied severely, as an
authority upon colours. “But it served to brighten up his face,
which was none too cheerful. Born under Saturn, I should
think, and the sign of the Scorpion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what effect has that?” asked Jinny, alarmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for one thing it qualifies the unruly actions and passions
of Venus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The goddess of Beauty,” observed Jinny, airing her Spelling-Book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of Love,” corrected Miss Gentry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s face shaded towards the colour under discussion, and
she cried: “Down, Nip,” to that recumbent animal’s amusement.
“He nearly jumped on the bonnet-box,” she explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He should eat herbs under the dominion of the Sun,” said
Miss Gentry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—Mr. Flynt. He needs vital spirits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, ginger is hardly the word,” murmured Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks ginger against his clothes,” persisted Miss Gentry.
“Of course a man can’t understand dressing himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he’s better dressed than anybody in Long Bradmarsh—except
Mr. Fallow,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry was mollified by the compliment to her pastor.
“All the same his coat wrinkles at the shoulders,” she said.
“You notice next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got better things to do than to look at Mr. Flynt’s coat-sleeves,”
said Jinny. “And I’ll be going on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you do see him, give him my kind regards,” said Miss
Gentry, “and say that any time he’s passing and would like a
cup of tea, I’d be glad to discuss the tract I gave him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s no use trying to convert him,” said Jinny. “He’s
nothing at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why did he go to your chapel the other Sunday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he go?” said Jinny, amazed. “I dare say that’s what
has depressed him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He not only went, but with your <span class='it'>peculiar</span> ideas of the House
of God, he had his dinner there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! Why he was dining at ‘The Black Sheep.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of the sort. A dressmaker has ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a carrier has eyes. And I saw him there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll never believe Isabella Mawhood again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you haven’t been making her more vanities,” said
Jinny, as she slowly turned Methusalem’s nose the other way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a new bonnet, you funny little Peculiar. You see the
case was coming on at the Chelmsford Sessions, and I should have
got a verdict against Mr. Mawhood not only for his wife’s silk
dress, but for the chickens his ferrets killed——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You issued a replevin, I suppose,” put in Jinny grandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could have had a tort or a subpœna or anything,” assented
Miss Gentry, with equal magnificence. “But the defendant
thought best to compromise. He’s got to clear this cottage of
rats for nothing this winter—you know how they come gnawing
my best stuffs—and in return my landlady has to pay for a new
bonnet for his wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Mrs. Mawhood’s silk dress—who pays for that?” asked
Jinny mystified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Mott pays for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why Mrs. Mott?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She didn’t want to have a scandal in the community, and
your so-called Deacon swore he hadn’t got the money. They
make Mrs. Mott pay for everything nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too bad,” said Jinny. “And Mrs. Mawhood comes out
of it all with her dress paid for and a new bonnet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she does become clothes more than her sister-Peculiars,
I must say that—present company excepted! That old rat-catcher’s
lucky to have got such a young wife for his second, even
though he was <span class='it'>her</span> third.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s not so young,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s no older than I am,” persisted Miss Gentry. “And
born, like me, under Venus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny suppressed a smile. Despite her respect for Miss Gentry
she had never accepted her standing invitation to explore the
Colchester romance. Unread in the literature of love though
she was, the girl’s natural instinct refused to see the middle-aged
moustachio’d dressmaker as the heroine of a love-drama. Her
affair with the angel seemed, indeed, to place her apart. “I
think it’s disgraceful to have had three husbands,” she insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, when each is a Christian marriage, and the first
two spouses have been duly taken by an overruling Providence.
Of course the unhallowed romance one inspires is another thing.
As I always say to Bundock—oh, we ought not to have mentioned
names, ought we, Squibs dear? Please forget it.” She
stroked the cat in her arms. “But there, Jinny! You can’t
understand these things—you too were born under Saturn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know that?” Jinny was vaguely resentful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re so cold-blooded—perhaps it was even under the constellation
of the Pisces—the Fishes, that is. You’ve never taken
the faintest interest in Love. Do you know, I made a rhyme
about you the other day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A rhyme!” Jinny was excited. “Do tell me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry shook her head. “You wouldn’t like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I <span class='it'>must</span> hear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry continued obstinately to stroke Squibs. But
finally, as if electrified by the fur, she broke out like an inspired
pythoness, in a weird chanting voice:</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>And Jinny shall then learn Passion’s force.</span>”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was so overwhelmed with admiration at the poetry—quite
on a par, she felt, with the pieces of “The Universal
Spelling-Book,” especially as the Rhyme or “<span class='it'>jingle in the ear</span>”
was on the very pattern of the model verse there given:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>—that she could hardly take in the sense at the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How lovely!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you’re satisfied. It means, of course”—Miss
Gentry firmly explained the oracle—“that you’ll never marry,
being as incapable of Passion as the Brad of flowing backwards
and forwards at the same time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange protest as written in letters of fire crept through all
Jinny’s veins. Even her face flamed. She began “clucking”
to Methusalem to start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ve made one about Mrs. Mawhood too,” pursued the
pythoness, now irrepressible. “I don’t wish her ill, but I’m
afraid it’ll prove true, poor thing.” And without waiting to be
discouraged, indeed, following the already moving cart, she
chanted:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Not dance!” laughed Jinny, relieved at this diversion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well preach—it’s just as bad, when a man’s not ordained,”
said Miss Gentry, and this being the signal for a theological
assault, Jinny drove off rapidly.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But she had no intention of bearing the bonnet to Frog Farm.
Nor, despite the account that Farmer Gale had given of the new
parcel arrangement, had she really agreed to establish him as
sub-carrier-in-ordinary. He was too moneyed and important for
that, and she found it hard enough to accept the favour of being
driven to and from chapel in his dog-cart—a favour necessitated
by her grandfather’s and even her own ideas as to the indecorum
of their business cart. Besides, she had almost resolved to seek
his advice, perhaps his help, in the famous horse-purchase: anything
rather than break down before Will! So she must not
overdo it. No, Master Peartree, for all his novel churlishness,
must convey the bonnet. He could scarcely be treated like
Farmer Gale’s boy, and if they did refuse it at his hands, still it
would only abide next door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shepherd-cowman was not, however, to be found in his
accustomed haunts, and she lost a good hour in hunting for him
in the various mutually distant pastures to which he led his
ever-edacious sheep. None of the men ploughing the great red
fields for turnips had seen him pass. At last, by the aid of a
taciturn lout, who was driving a tumbril laden with hurdles and
backed with a tall crate, Master Peartree was located in the
farm buildings at the other extremity of Farmer Gale’s estate in
a barn-like structure facing a long row of cart-sheds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Skirting a sunless pond that was scurvy and ill-smelling, she
drew up at the gate and blew a summons on her horn, but its
only effect was to startle the chickens pecking in the litter, and
the piglings fighting to snatch their mother’s garbage from her
tub or to nuzzle at her teats. There was nothing for it but to
carry the bonnet-box to the barn, for the great farmyard was
too mucky to drag her cart through. Picking her way among
the strawy compost heaps, she divined why her horn had brought
no answer: it had been deadened by a melody proceeding in a
lusty tenor voice from the tall folding-doors, and this—somewhat
to her surprise—was none other than the air of “Buy a Broom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It forced her to polka to it the rest of the way, and although
she must fain trip gingerly mid the manure-heaps and the melody
had ended with applause before she reached the thatched
structure, still it was with a brighter feeling that she found
herself at the open doors. But the first glimpse within made
her turn pale and draw back a little. The scene she had so
unexpectedly stumbled upon was the stranger and grimmer for
the silence that had now fallen, though the faces of the shearers
astride the struggling sheep were still lively enough. Master
Peartree had his boot over the head of a recalcitrant lamb, which
but for her recent adventure she would have imagined choking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not the ungentle shepherd that made for
her the centre of the picture, for among these men in dirty
green corduroys and rolled-up check shirt-sleeves, whose legs
gripped grunting, wheezing, struggling or feebly kicking sheep,
was one in cleaner clothes, whose bare, brawny arms gave her a
sharp sensation, almost as if he had nipped her with the shears
he held in his palm. Was it boredom or the need for his labour
that had enlisted Mr. William Flynt in this service? She did
not know, but pale and dumb she retreated from the unconscious
Will, whose sheep, wedged between his legs, hung limp with
meek, helpless eye, the very image of a sacrificial victim, and
was being sheared with the meticulous concentration of the
outsider bent on showing he is not inferior to the professional.
And indeed Will’s was the sole sheep, she saw at once and with
admiration, that though nearly bare of its wool showed without
blood-fleck: a consummation to which its prudent lethargy had
doubtless contributed. Young Ravens, on the other hand, who
was now lying with both feet on his animal, had nicked it on ear,
leg, and breast: apparently one could not serve two masters—song
and scissors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving Jinny with her bonnet-box, this young humorist
now sang out the old street-cry: “Buy a band-box!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chaff stayed her retreat and stiffened her trembling form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo!” she retorted, with less than her usual wit. “Back
again like a bad penny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as she spoke she saw Will and his sheep give a spasmodic
start, and the first speck of blood appear on the flawless skin.
But the shearer did not look up, although he automatically
stretched out his hand for the ointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do ye don’t struggle,” observed Master Peartree amiably to
his youthful ewe. “Oi’m not so strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As nobody said anything further, and Master Peartree, intent
on his lamb, did not look up, Jinny too stood silent for a moment
with her incongruous bonnet-box; recovering her sang-froid, and
watching a catcher trying to drive in an unshorn lamb from the
pen in which it had cowered and which it now ran round, bleating,
terror-stricken and unseizable. She wondered if its heart were
thumping more wildly than hers. Not that there was terror in her
own breast—rather a strange exultation that her presence had had
power to incarnadine the immaculate sheepskin. But her eyes
roamed shyly from Will and his nipped victim, and studied with
elaborate attention the divers coloured show-cards of the successful
ram lambs that made their vaunt upon the beams or
along the sloping walls, through which the thatching stuck
pleasantly. Her mind went back to that sunny, bracing day in
February, to the immense pastoral landscape of straw-roofed
sheep-pens, ooze, mangold heaps, and haystacks, on which she
had chanced when the lambs now so agitated were new-yeaned:
some only an hour or two old, with long skeleton legs and bodies
smeared as with yellow gold. How friskily they had soon learnt
to leap on their mother’s back! That day she, too, had been
as untroubled, needing no outside melody to brisk up her pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Ravens, inspired by his new audience to a fresh burst
of melody, started on “The Mistletoe Bough,” the old ballad she
had heard sung in the cottages at Christmas sing-songs, and
which she now for the first time connected with the play on
Mr. Flippance’s posters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Jinny,” said Master Peartree at last, her presence
slowly percolating. He finished his rebellious lamb and patted
it forgivingly on the back, remarking genially: “Get up and
let’s have a squint at you.” And as it trotted out happily, he
threw its fleece—too small to wind up—on to a great heap in
the corner and fell to work on a sheep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve just done’em when it’s turned cold,” protested Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ’tis a pity,” said Master Peartree. “But first we
couldn’t get the labour, and then that rined and their wool was
too damp, but Oi need ’em now for the early market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. I’m buying a horse there,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another tinge of red appeared on the blameless skin of Will’s
victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Methusalem ain’t damaged hisself?” asked Master Peartree
in concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, he’s outside your gate, damaging your hedge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then whatever do you need another for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just to ride over somebody. But I wish I’d known you
needed labour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, want a job?” grinned Jim Puddifoot, a giant in a
brimless hat, who was sharpening his shears on a piece of steel.
There was a snigger from his mates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the pay?” said Jinny, who had been thinking of
Uncle Lilliwhyte, lately gravelled for lack of purchasers of his
woodland pickings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s half a suvrin a hundred,” said Master Peartree as
seriously, “and four quarts o’ beer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great shout of laughter rose from the hired men: only Will
went on shearing with apparent imperturbability, while a third
carmine speck defaced the smooth surface of his martyred
sheep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the laugh?” inquired Master Peartree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Don’t rob a poor man of his beer</span>,” carolled young Ravens.
“She don’t drink,” he broke off to explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do, I drink like a fish. Water, that is, like that does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time even Master Peartree laughed, while Jim Puddifoot,
raising his tin mug without a handle to his mouth, cried “Here’s
to you,” and young Ravens lifting up his pleasant voice trolled
forth:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Little stabs and pricks were going through Will’s breast, and
still more through the skin of his sheep. As the chorus, from
which Jinny’s little trill was not excluded, took up:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>“<span class='it'>With a high jig jiggity, tops and petticoats,</span></p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'> it seemed to Will as if Jinny was carrying on like a flash lady
in a boon company. A high jig jiggity, indeed! Releasing his
victim at last, he picked up its fleece sullenly and teased a tail
out of it, wherewith, rolling up the rest, he proceeded to tie the
bundle in a silence that the singing rendered still grimmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that you’ve got there, Jinny?” asked Master Peartree,
becoming suddenly aware of the bonnet-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s for you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! Oi ain’t got no womankind, thank the Lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Master Peartree had touched unintentionally the springs
of laughter. Will pinned the frightened ewe-lamb, now caught
and as dumb as himself, between his legs, and plucked a few preliminary
bits from its breast with his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s Mrs. Flynt’s bonnet,” explained Jinny, “and will
you oblige me by taking it back to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snick of young Flynt’s shears sounded savage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Oi won’t,” said Master Peartree, “seein’ as here stands
her boy Willie hisself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, does he?” said Jinny. “I hadn’t noticed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, that he do. And even dedn’t, he arxed me not to do
your job agen, time Oi took in that liddle ole horn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new ovine martyr bounded. Quite a patch of its skin had
been replaced by blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady, Willie, steady!” cried Master Peartree. “Oi was
afeared musicianers ain’t no good for shearing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s this silly, jumping beast,” growled Will, breaking his
obstinate silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was still tendering the bonnet-box to Master Peartree.
“Well, give it to him then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t he take it straight?” asked the shepherd, clipping
busily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That silly, jumping beast is too much for him as it is. He
daren’t let go. I’ll leave the bonnet-box for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t no place here—’tis too mucky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Buy a Broom,’ ” hummed Jinny, and young Ravens, smiling,
seized a besom and swept vigorously at the stale and droppings.
“Oh, I can’t leave it here—the sheep might stave it in,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it in the store acrost the yard—the key’s in the
padlock,” said the shepherd. “Oi count Willie’ll take it home,
same as he ain’t cut hisself to pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another roar from the others—this time Master Peartree
beamed, and it might have gone ill with Will’s lamb had the
shears not slipped from his palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but when folks go woolgathering,” remarked Jinny
blandly, “they forget things. I’ll put it in the store, but I won’t
be responsible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her I won’t forget it,” roared Will, who was picking up
his shears in the gymnastic attitude necessitated by the palpitating
sheep between his legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi reckon she can yer for herself,” said the shepherd naïvely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I can hear,” said Jinny. “But tell him to tell his
mother that the bill’s inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi reckon <span class='it'>he</span> can yer too,” said the puzzled Peartree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t listen much to women,” explained Jinny. “You
ask him if his family wants anything else from Chipstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there he stands—you can arx him, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t I stand here, too?” said Jinny. “And why
doesn’t he answer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s too shy,” sniggered Ravens, and burst out again:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up!” snarled Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twas you asked me to sing,” retorted Ravens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so, Willie,” said the shepherd. “You should say you
loved to yer ‘Buy a Broom’ and all them old songs. Why don’t
you answer, Willie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because there’s nothing to say,” Will roared. “We don’t
want nothing whatever from her.” He was not often so ungrammatical,
but anger knows no pedantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, why couldn’t he say so at once?” said Jinny, and
whistling “<span class='it'>A dashing young man from Buckingham</span>,”—whistling
was a new brazenness in Will’s ears—she picked her way across
the miry yard to the weather-boarded, tarred, and tile-roofed
structure that stood on six mushroom-topped pillars, whose
smoothness offered no purchase for rats. Ascending the steep
steps, she deposited the bonnet-box betwixt the chicken-corn
and the eggs. While padlocking the door again, she saw to her
surprise that Methusalem was inside the gate, labouring towards
her through the mud. The faithful animal, impatient for her,
had evidently lifted the latch with its nose, aided perhaps by its
teeth. The tears came into her eyes: some one at least did
want her, and there was a long, affectionate contact between
that clever, velvety nose and Jinny’s palm. Then she returned
to the shearing-barn and handed Master Peartree the key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good day and thank you,” she said. “I reckon I shall meet
you at the cattle fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not wait to see if she had drawn blood from the sacrificial
lamb; but, rounding her lips again, whistled her way
jauntily back to her cart. As she drove along, the sun, struggling
through a high cloud-rack, showed like a great worn silver coin,
and the shorn sheep gleamed fairily white on the great green
pastures. But there was an ache at her heart, which the delicious
wafts from the early-mown hayfields only made emptier.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The shabby little cart with the legend of “Daniel Quarles,”
and the smart dog-cart of Farmer Gale, rolled side by side of a
Monday morning in the restored June sunshine towards the
Chipstone cattle-market. Jinny had timed this coincidence, and
meant to extract the farmer’s opinion of the horses for sale. She
had already gleaned from her grandfather what particular teeth
were chronological, but such confidence as she possessed in her
own “horse-sense” had been rudely dissipated by a volume on
the noble animal, which she had unearthed in Mother Gander’s
sanctum. The lists of diseases and defects from which it might
suffer was paralysing, and even when it was a thing she had
heard of—like grogginess—it grew more sinister by being called
“navicular disease.” Methusalem’s maladies had been simple
enough, and she had dared to drench or anoint him with divers
remedies. But now that knowledge had dissipated the bliss of
ignorance—now that warts had enlarged into “angleberries,”
rheumatism had darkened into “felon,” and farcy, quittor, <span class='it'>Ascaris
megalocephala</span>, and countless other evils were seen hovering
around Methusalem, thick as summer gnats, she marvelled how
he had staved them off. That poor Methusalem! An affectionate
animal by nature was the horse,—the book told her—he
<span class='it'>wanted</span> to please man, only sometimes he was in agony and the
flesh could not obey. Good heavens, what if sometimes when
she was in a hurry to get home, she had wronged Methusalem,
even in her thoughts! Remorsefully, and with a new and
morbid anxiety, she caressed his delicate, nose, amazed at her
ancient, easy assurance of his immortality. It even shook her
faith in the all-sufficiency of the Spelling-Book that it contained
no intimation of the ills that horseflesh is heir to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the animal she had now to buy for Mr. Flippance might
be affected with all or any of these ills, and even if one could
detect such obvious defects as windgalls, spavin, thorough-pin, or
broken wind, how avoid a crib-biter or a wind-sucker, how
grapple with the bot-fly, two hundred of which could hook themselves
horribly to a single equine stomach, or with the still more
formidable Palisade Worm, which even its name of <span class='it'>Strongylus
armatus</span> could scarcely worsen, a thousand of it having been
counted by a patient authority on a surface of two inches, and
its census taken at a million for a single horse!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farmer Gale, however, failed to throw much light on these
alarming questions, which he did not know, indeed, were being
asked. His conversation kept gliding away to his grievances,
for it consisted, like that of most farmers, of grumbles. Usually
these started from the little string-tied sample bags of threshed
grain he carried in his pocket to be blown and tasted by hard-bargaining
customers. But to-day, though he was not bound
for the corn-market, he was nevertheless not to be baulked of
his grievances. They were not, this time, against Nature, but
against Man; for, as the fields they passed showed, the corn was
particularly forward. It was not Providence that had run down
wheat to thirty shillings a quarter. Free Trade was in reality
the ruin of free Britain. For the labour of Continental slaves,
who went with the soil, and were sold with it like cattle, who
subsisted on black bread, skim-milk, and onions, was brought
into competition with that of the freeborn Briton, who must
thus be dragged down to the same level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bluff, freeborn Briton was Farmer Gale’s favourite rôle,
and his ruddy face, grey bowler, and smart gaiters made him
sympathetic enough superficially, while the potent landowner’s
consideration for Jinny’s religious necessities had not failed to
evoke a flattered gratitude in her humble breast when they drove
together of a Sunday to their respective chapels. This amiable
image of himself the breezy Briton was now destined to shatter.
For after some critical comment on the ploughing of the fields
they passed and the activities of the poachers—he would certainly
have to get rid of that suspicious character, “Uncle Lilliwhyte,”
who occupied a cottage badly needed for a farm-hand—he pointed
out the impossibility of building another cottage as Jinny had
so crudely suggested. Prices were simply ruinous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell my labourers as man to man,” he said emphatically,
“that they can’t have regular employment <span class='it'>and</span> their present
wages. Take your choice, boys, says I. Look at other countries,
do they get more than their six or seven shillings a week? No!
Then that’s what you’ll have to come down to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can they live on it?” asked Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can farmers live?” he retorted. “We must go by the
price of corn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But did you go by the price of corn after the Battle of
Waterloo?” asked Jinny shrewdly. “For I remember Gran’fer
once telling me you got—I mean your father got—a hundred
shillings a quarter then, yet folks were so starved they went
burning the ricks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was only a baby then. I can’t say what happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the same thing happened nearer our time,” she reminded
him, thinking of the Bidlake tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that silly rioting and machine-smashing. That always
came out of the poor not understanding politics. If things were
bad after Waterloo, it was all Bony’s work. And as for the
unrest twenty years ago, we caught that from France, too, I
remember dad telling me. They had risen against their king—such
an unsettled people. But to-day it’s our own British
Government that’s the enemy, and the money we farmers have
lost this year is something dreadful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t look as starved as some of our labourers’
families. I’ve seen the Pennymole children crying for dry
bread, and the father saying, ‘I darsn’t cut you no more—do,
ye’ll have none Saturday.’ And Mr. Pennymole’s always worked
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t understand politics, Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand poverty. The Pennymoles are better off, now
they’ve got two boys grown up and earning sixpence a day. But
I’ve seen Mrs. Pennymole making tea with charred bread, and
her husband compelled to steal the cabbages left for the cows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Oh, I oughtn’t to have said that,” she added in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly oughtn’t! <span class='it'>Compelled</span> to break the Eighth
Commandment—a pretty doctrine! And such liars, too. I
saw quite a little girl munching a turnip she’d just filched from
my field, and when I complained to her mother, the woman
unblushingly said, ‘’Tis me fats her up with swedes and
turnips.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can’t see their children hunger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can put some of them in the poorhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at the mites there, white and half-starved. Sometimes
I’ve got to deliver a parcel to Mr. Jims, the porter, and I hear
the Master thrashing ’em with a stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s what boys need—even my brat. Carrying parcels,
indeed!” He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but they make the old folks of eighty and ninety scour
the stone steps and do the washing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They needn’t go in—they can get relief from the parish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The parish! Eighteenpence a week for the family when the
father’s bedridden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the parish loaves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever seen one? Half-baked, without real crust,
all raw and soft, where it stuck to the next loaf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beggars can’t be choosers. Besides, there’s plenty of work
after harvest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, even for babies of six,” said Jinny bitterly. “And to
keep boys from their beds after hard field-work. And at White
Notley where they make the silk, there’s little girls standing
on stools to reach the weaving-desk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you understood politics,” Farmer Gale persisted, “you’d
understand that prices make themselves, and that what we get
with one hand we have to give away with the other. Have you
ever heard of the Income Tax now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” admitted Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! You’d change your tune if you had to pay a shilling
on every pound you earned. But that’s merely the last straw
that breaks the camel’s back, for it isn’t only as a farmer I’m put
upon. But think of the Malt Tax! It’s simply a scandal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it? I should have thought ’twas six shillings a week
would be the scandal.” Her eyes and cheeks blazed prettily,
and she was beginning to shelve the idea of consulting her
companion at the horse-market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t say you’re altogether wrong,” conceded Farmer Gale,
admiring, despite himself, her fire and sparkle. “But it’s the
Government that’s responsible. There was a great old meeting
t’other day at Drury Lane Theatre in London. Two thousand
people, if a man. The Duke of Richmond he up and said by
Heaven we’ve got to have Protection, and we will have it. Oh,
it was a grand speech. I went up for it express. And we’ve
had a meeting of farmers down here, too, and we’re going to
wake up the country, we Essex chaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you?” said Jinny, secretly amused at this “furriner’s”
complacent identification of himself with her county.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wait! We’re going to come out with a Proclamation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s a Royal thing,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always: besides we shall end with <span class='it'>God save the Queen</span>.
Yes, that’s it: ‘Down with the Malt Tax and God save the
Queen!’ And the beginning: ‘To our worthy labourers,
greeting.’ I’ll draw that up soon as I get home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should offer ’em ten shillings a week,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re joking!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m dead earnest. A family can’t live under ten shillings a
week. Then they wouldn’t want to shoot your rabbits and steal
your turnips and cabbages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prices make themselves, I tell you. Folks can’t have more
than they’re worth. Why, my dad paid as much as thirteen
shillings a week to our old looker, Flynt, when he had his strength.
Yes, though nobody ever suspected he got more than twelve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But besides his duties as bailiff he had to see after feeding
the stock night and morning, including Sundays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was why my father paid him the extra shilling. And you
can’t say I haven’t treated him generously over the farmhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder he could bring up such a large family so genteelly,”
mused Jinny at a tangent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more the easier. A brat of four can scare the crows:
the only pity is that his boys wouldn’t stay on the land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was there to stay for? I think there ought to be a
law that nobody gets under ten shillings,” persisted Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a blessing we haven’t got women over us,” said the
farmer, smiling at a heresy too unreasonable for argument.
“Men Governments are bad enough, but women would drive us
to the workhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about the Queen?” asked Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>what</span> about the Queen?” he repeated vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t the Queen a woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Queen a woman!” He was dazed. “But she doesn’t
really govern—not nowadays. It’s Lord John!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then, what about Queen Elizabeth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that was some time back,” he said evasively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she put on the crown in 1558, November 17,” quoted
Jinny from that Spelling-Book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know you were so well up in history,” he said
admiringly. “I reckon you’re ready at ciphering too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could I do my work without it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that’s true. And a good hand at a pen, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can scratch what I want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fell silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t play the piano?” he asked after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Jinny. “Only the horn.” And she blew gaily
upon it: whereupon to her surprise and satisfaction—for she
had forgotten him, and it was necessary to tie him up against
the sheep—Nip appeared, tearing from the rear. Farmer Gale
watched musingly the operation of confining him to his basket
by one of those pieces of hoop-borne rope that had excited the
speculation of Mr. Elijah Skindle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you could play a polka on it,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny obliged with a few bars of the “Buy a Broom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had a piano,” he observed with growing admiration,
“I expect you’d soon learn to play it on that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny shook her head. “I shall never have the time. There’s
the goats, and the garden, and Gran’fer, and Methusalem——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly all g’s,” laughed Farmer Gale, exhilarated by his
own erudition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And isn’t Methusalem a gee?” flashed Jinny, and exhilarated
him further by her prodigious wit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both smiling broadly as, just outside the market,
they came upon Will leaning against a lime-tree, a pipe between
his teeth and a darkness palpable on his forehead despite its
“ginger” aureola.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s smile died and her heart thumped. Instantaneously
she decided that as the farmer had seen them together at “The
Black Sheep,” to ignore Will absolutely would be to betray
their quarrel to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine morning!” she cried as the vehicles passed. Will
sullenly touched his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was amazed that the Cornish potentate should countenance
her presence, so incongruous amid this orgie of untempered
masculinity, this medley of unpetticoated humanity of every
rank and class, of which drovers twirling branches or leaning on
sticks formed the ground pattern: small farmers rubbing
shoulders with smart-gaitered gentry in frilled shirts; blue-aproned
butchers with scissors at breast jostling peasants in
grimy smock-frocks and squash hats or ruddy, whiskered old
squires and great grazier farmers in blue, gilt-buttoned coats,
white flap buff waistcoats, and white pot or broad-brimmed
hats; still more elegant town types in glossy, straight-brimmed
cylinders and double-breasted, green frock-coats galling the kibes
of bucolic, venerable-bearded ancients in fusty sleeved waistcoats
and greasy high-hats, who blew their noses with black fingers.
It was a fantasia of pipes and caps, of immaculate collars and
dirty scarves, of broadcloth cutaways and filthy Cardigan
jackets, of top-booted buckskins and corduroy trousers tied with
string below the knee. As Jinny and Farmer Gale alighted, and
mingled with this grotesque mob swirling around the pens in the
sunshine, Will’s heart was hot with resentment against the girl
who, while rejecting the counsel and co-operation of her old
friend in the great horse-deal, had brazenly accepted the guidance
of a bumptious “furriner.” How shamelessly she walked amid
that babel of moos, baas, grunts, shouts, and bell-ringing, as if
here was her natural place. Really, to see smoke puffing publicly
out of her mouth, as it had puffed privately out of that Polly’s,
would hardly be surprising now. And the men were looking
after her, there could be no doubt of that, appraising her as if
she, too, was in the market. He could not but feel a faint relief
that she was under substantial masculine escort, however
abhorred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The market-place, along which our quite unconscious Jinny
was now making so indiscreet a tourney, was constructed outside
the town proper, bordered on two sides by lime-trees and open
to the sky save in the auction-room and bar, where walls and
roofing gave a grateful shade, though the company in either did
not contribute coolness. The cattle were shuffling about restlessly,
jostling, mounting. The store calves and bullocks lay in
pens; the fatted calves had already been sold: pathetic plumpnesses
about to be butchered. Butchers, indeed, were already
emerging from the auction-room leading struggling strap-muzzled
calves by head-ropes, and holding on—for extra precaution—to
their tails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor creatures!” said Jinny, with tears coming to her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a poor lot!” assented Farmer Gale, and if Will could
have felt the flash of scorn that went through Jinny’s heart, he
would have scowled less. There was a store calf, stamped in
blue, so tiny that Jinny longed to mother it. Here again the
farmer blundered: he doubted if anybody would buy it; at
least it would be killed instanter to be mixed with pork for
sausages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a widower, Jinny remembered, and the line in the
Spelling-Book defining that word floated suddenly before her
illumined mind: “Widower—<span class='it'>One who has buried his wife.</span>”
There had always seemed to her something superfluously sinister
in that definition—as if the husband had personally put his wife
out of the way, or at least made sure she was disposed of. Was
a man a widower whose wife had been burnt up, she had wondered
whimsically. Or if Miss Gentry had been married and gone to
sea and been duly drowned, would her husband have been free
to remarry? But for Farmer Gale at least, how pat was the
definition, she felt. He assuredly suggested the wilful widower:
this man without entrails of mercy, whether for the poor or for
beasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved away silently, trying to lose him, looking for the
horses. She passed pens of sheep, and dogs (only a few of these,
and tied), and cows with swollen, oozy udders. There was a
sheep nibbling at a fallen lime branch outside its pen, and another
shoving hard to displace him. Jinny picked it up and gave it
to this covetous creature, who sniffed and then turned away.
There seemed to be a sort of Spelling-Book moral in it. Before
the pigs (red-crossed and blue-marked) she found Master Peartree
in rapt contemplation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pegs be lookin’ thrifty and prosperous,” he observed, in
response to her asking how <span class='it'>he</span> found himself. “They don’t need
no auctioneer’s gammon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No pig does,” punned Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, here we are!” said a less welcome voice—Jinny maliciously
referred Farmer Gale’s “we” to his juxtaposition with
the pigs. The uneasy capping and ducking of the shepherd-cowman
before his master, and his moving off towards his own
animals, suggested that pigs were a private passion with Master
Peartree. But he had brought up the memory of the shearing-shed,
and with it the renewed thought of Will, and it was a
tenderer thought than for the potentate at her side. Will might
be stubborn and silly, but never, surely, would he deny that no
family should have less than ten shillings a week: she felt
relieved she had broken the ice between them, even though
“Fine morning” was only a little hole in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if echoing her thoughts, “Fine morning!” said the pig-auctioneer
to Farmer Gale. It was a special mark of attention
from this gentlemanly-looking man, elevated on a massive stool,
who wore gaiters and a great gleaming signet-ring that showed
as he turned the pages of a written catalogue. This was kept by
elastic strings in a grand calf cover, though pigskin would have
seemed more in keeping. Two acolytes, standing on the ground,
scribbled in their lowliness. Buyers sat on the rim of the pens,
with their feet dangling over the pigs, and the pig-drovers
hovered near, in their long high aprons of coarse brown sacking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon Farmer Gale became as fascinated as Master Peartree, for
the pigs did indeed look “thrifty and prosperous,” and as the
penful was on the point of falling to a low bid, he nipped in and
secured a bargain. While he was complacently cutting away
bristles, signing his acquisition with his scissors, Jinny stole
away, feeling he was safely penned.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Will had long since disappeared from her ken, but when she
came to the long roofed place, open at the side, where beribboned
and straw-plaited hacks and draught-horses were tied to their
staples, there he was, chained just as firmly by a sort of sentinel
stubbornness. It was as if he was saying “Through my body
first!” The thrill his proximity gave her was shot through with
a renewed resentment against this obviously undiminished opposition
of his. But she was resolved to meet him with banter
rather than with anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You buying horses?” she said genially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am not buying horses!” he answered roughly. “But
aren’t you ashamed to be here—the only one of your sex?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely not!” said Jinny. “Where’s your eyes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked round, wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Under your nose!” guided Jinny. “There, isn’t that a
mare? And I passed sows and ewes and heifers by the score.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s what you class yourself with? And then you
deny you are lowering yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always lower myself when I get off my cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you get up again! That’s the best advice I can give
you. Drive home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And shirk my job!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I’ll</span> do your job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You! I thought you were not buying horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what I mean. How much does old Flippance
want to give?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’s not so old,” she said evasively. She was scanning
the horses with troubled eye, perturbed even more than by her
own affairs by the thought of the innumerable diseases and
defects and doctorings which might be lurking beneath their
sheen of health and vigour. Her innocent faith undermined by
literature and Mr. Flippance’s experience, she had a cynical sense
of horsey hypocrisy, of whited, blacked, or browned sepulchres,
within which fearsome worms burrowed in their millions. She
would have gladly consulted Will, had he not been so tactlessly
intrusive. Even as it was, she murmured encouragingly:
“There doesn’t seem much choice to-day.” Indeed, the animals
were mostly huge shire horses with their heavily feathered fetlocks.
Of hackneys there were only two or three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should take that Suffolk Punch,” advised Will, indicating
a chestnut. “He’ll have the strength to draw the caravan, and
doesn’t look so clumsy and hairy-legged as the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like the star on his forehead,” said Jinny. “But I can’t
bear a cropped tail, it’s cruel. Besides, Mr. Flippance hasn’t got
a caravan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how does he carry all that truck I saw?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that goes in wagons with horses just hired from town
to town. They don’t even live in a caravan like Mr. Duke’s
got. No, but they have a trap that they drive over in, ahead, and
then Mr. Flippance uses the trap to look for a pitch to hire, or
to bring home naphtha for the lamps or timber for mending the
theatre—something always goes wrong, he says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’d have the Cleveland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is the Cleveland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That tall bay with black points and clean legs. I’ve hardly
ever seen one at an Essex fair, but they’re strong as plough-horses
and handsome as hackneys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But don’t you think that couple there are handsomer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The black—of course! They’re a pair of real carriage
horses. Splendid action, I reckon. But Mr. Flippance won’t
want anything so showy as that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what a show does want,” laughed Jinny. “You see he
also rides about the town, blowing on the horn and scattering
handbills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t understand that. And can he blow a horn as
well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As well as who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As me!” said Will boldly. “And when am I to have my
gloves?” He sought her hand in the press and it was not
withdrawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you go blowing it for Mr. Flippance in his next town,”
she laughed happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must choose the horse I blow behind,” he said with
an air of lightness. “What’s the most old Flippance will go
to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirty pounds is his last word, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much too little. But we’ll see. Now I’ll take you back to
your cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?” Her hand unclasped. “I’ve got to buy the
horse, I must wait here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they’ll be taken in there.” He pointed to the cattle
auction-chamber. “And there’s no need for you to bid personally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall enjoy bidding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Among all those men? You won’t even get a look in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chamber was indeed besieged by a seething crowd, some
standing on tiptoe, astrain to get their bids marked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll borrow one of those pig-dealers’ stools,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do be serious, Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you suppose my work is a joke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can’t squeeze in that crowd? Suppose we find
out the owner and get one of the black horses by private
treaty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And pay the market fee? Not me! Besides, he’ll want a
top price and there’s more fun and chances in bidding. Oh look!
that poor Cleveland’s got himself all tangled up! Do help
him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not easy to release the animal which, having encoiled
its legs in the rope attached to its staple, was getting more and
more frightened as its own efforts lassoed it the tighter. Jinny’s
heart beat fast lest Will should get kicked, and still faster
at the nonchalance with which he accomplished his dangerous
task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” she said sweetly, when the animal stood
shaking, but quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not your horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I asked you to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you might do what I ask <span class='it'>you</span>?” he retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She frowned. She did not like this tricky tit-for-tat. It was
unchivalrous. It undid his deed of derring-do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not interfere with my business,” she said severely,
and swept to the nearest door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny! Where are you going?” He had followed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the bar!” she said solemnly, perceiving the nature of the
forbidden chamber. “Why can’t I have a drink and a smoke?
What will you take?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gasped, believing her serious. So female smoking even in
public was no impossible foreboding. To this buffet, blockaded
by laughing, swilling, tobacco-clouded masculinity, mitigated
only—if not indeed aggravated—by a barmaid, Jinny was
actually going to wriggle her way! And the buffet did not even
sell milk!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shan’t go,” he said in a low hoarse tone, clutching at
her arm. “By God, you shan’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he succeeded only in grasping her dangling horn, and, in
her dart forward, it was left in his hand. “I didn’t ask you to
‘take’ that!” she laughed back as she crossed the threshold. “I
meant, what’s your drink?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny!” he breathed, his voice frozen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine’s ink!” she called out gaily, and the males, now aware
of her presence, vied with one another to pass the bottle and
pen on the counter to her, together with the little bowl of sand,
all of which she bore to the quiet side of the room, where a
protracted desk supplied facilities for notes and accounts. Reassured,
but still resentful, Will stood at the door, awkwardly
holding her horn with its bit of broken girdle, and watching her
protectively as she scribbled on a piece of paper, and blotted it
with the sand. Then coming back to him, she took away her
horn—not without a reproachful glance at the snapped cord—and
putting her folded paper into his hand instead, glided past
him and was lost in the hurly-burly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Disconsolate, yet excited, he opened the note, and read this
wholly unexpected quatrain:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Where Vice and Folly have an equal Share.</span></p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This rebuke, drawn from the endless thesaurus of “The Universal
Spelling-Book,” and not original even in spelling, Will
believed to be Jinny’s own composition, and as inspired as it
was, alas! deserved. Wonderful that Jinny could sit down in
all that turmoil, in that smoky, gin-laden atmosphere, and pour
out these pure bursts of song. Surely Martin Tupper, the mighty
bard of the day, whose renown had reached even Will’s illiterate
ears, could not better them. And what was he, Will, beside her,
he whose own claim to literature rested upon an imaginary
exposition of Daniel! Smarting with self-reproach, he deposited
the note where once her glove had rested—it should be a text of
warning henceforward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if she was thus marvellous, still more necessary was it to
withdraw her from these unfitting atmospheres, and he returned
more tenaciously than ever to his equine watch, like a picket in
a camp.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Jinny had blotted herself out in the crowd around
the sheep-auctioneer, who towered in the midst of his dirty-white
sea, yelling “All going at thirty-five shillings apiece!” or striding
from pen to pen across the bars, while the buyers ruddled their
lots with their mark, and the drovers cleared for him ever fresh
passages among the swirling sheep, and acolytes kept parallel to
him outside the fold with their ink-horns and notebooks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had only fallen from the frying-pan into the oven, for
suddenly she became conscious that Farmer Gale was again at
her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got your horse yet?” he inquired, with his breeziest British
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sale not on yet,” she answered coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then come and see the bullocks sell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny, pleading she must go to the horse sale-room, moved
away towards the congested chamber. He followed, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that <span class='it'>is</span> where they’re selling the bullocks now,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brain was seeking for a further pretext, when she caught
sight of the sentinel Will frowning furiously in her direction. If
she slipped in now, further argument from him would be nipped
in the bud, and silently she followed the robustious widower
through the hole he bored into the seething mass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entry of a female attracted no general attention, for it was
impossible for the squeezed buyers to see more than the backs
and sides of their immediate neighbours, even if all eyes had not
been on the auctioneer and on the beasts which occupied the
central ring, in the brief moments of their glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood at a raised desk, this master of the revels, in his
shirt-sleeves, with a little stick for hammer: a clean-shaven man,
with the back of his long head almost straight, and further
lengthened and straightened by the continuation down it of the
central parting of his neatly combed hair; the face bulging
forward and into a massive mouth and chin. He was flanked by
two young bookkeepers, one spotty-faced and spectacled in a
Scotch cap and loud tweeds, and one bareheaded and demure;
and around him on the rising benches of an amphitheatre rose a
mass of masculinity surmounted by small boys. Drovers chevied
in the “lots”—stuck with paper numbers—through large
double wooden gates, and back—after their great moments in
the ring—to their pens, through a smaller folding gate. The beasts
did not always listen proudly to their praises: the more modest,
instead of showing off their beauties, preferred to nose restfully
about the straw of the floor, and had to be prodded into circular
activity by the sticks of drovers who, as the bullocks went
sullenly round, looked like a prose variety of picador in a toy
arena. And throughout fell the auctioneer’s patter, sometimes
suave and slow, but for the most part staccato and breathless.
“Who will say seventy shillings? Property of Mr. Purley of
Foxearth Farm. And a crown. You all know Foxearth Farm.
You all know the hurdle-maker. And his herds are even better
than his hurdles! Who makes level money? Going, going——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t <span class='it'>you</span> be going,” said Farmer Gale smilingly. For
the girl had begun to edge out. She felt herself uncomfortably
pressed. Why, it almost seemed as if Farmer Gale’s arm were
round her waist. Good heavens, it was! And what was more,
his body barred her movement outwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take away your arm,” she whispered fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m protecting you from the crowd,” he whispered back.
“They’ll break your ribs in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it away!” she hissed. But he feigned not to hear, and
his eye being now on the arena, not on her, she was too shy to
struggle and make a sensation. The horn in her hand also
impeded her efforts to extricate herself. Furious and flushing,
she was forced to stand there, while the auctioneer’s prosy patter
beat down on her brain in a maddening ceaseless pour: “Selling
to the highest bidder—no reserve. A big bullock. In your
hands. Start the bidding, please. To be sold without reserve,
I say. How much? Come on! Look at his fat! Thank you.
Seven pound, fifteen—nine pound, ten—a great big bullock.
I’m selling him without reserve. He is to be sold whatever he
fetches. Ten pound, two and six. Going! No, not gone yet!
Going——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go!” repeated Jinny. “I must inspect the horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll see them better in the ring here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go! I’ll never drive to chapel with you again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not, Jinny?” He bent down with sudden passion, all
the cautious Cornishman’s long-wavering desires clenched by the
discovery of her high educational endowments and concreted by
actual contact with the desirable waist. “Why not go to chapel
together and be done with it, once for all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done with what?” she murmured, reddening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Separating. Let me keep off the crowd always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! They’ll hear you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they won’t. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be quiet! I want to hear the bidding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we publish the banns?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny closed her lips obstinately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you speak? You know I can buy out half Little
Bradmarsh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her silence the voice of the auctioneer possessed the
situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best heifer for the last—maiden heifer, beautiful quality.
Fourteen pound. Marvellous creature, marvellously cheap.
Won’t anybody start me?” The drover prodded the prodigy
up, and she trotted round dismally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen,” cried a squeaky voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen,” echoed the auctioneer, cheering up. But his gloom
soon returned. For the bidding refused to advance. “Being
badly sold, this heifer,” he wailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By crum, he’s right!” quoth the Cornishman, pricking up
his ears. “Sixteen pound!” he cried aloud, and was already
congratulating himself upon his bargain, when, like the voice of
doom, came the squeaky “Seventeen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farmer Gale was piqued. “Eighteen,” he said surlily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a staggering blow. But it only raised the farmer’s
blood. “Guineas!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-two pounds!” chirped the voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-two pounds!” repeated the auctioneer insatiably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beads of perspiration and hesitation appeared on the farmer’s
brow. In his concentration on the problem his arm relaxed.
Jinny stepped aside, and men unconsciously made way for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guineas!” cried the farmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-two guineas!” repeated the auctioneer. “A beautiful
maiden heifer—never had a calf. Going——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this time Jinny was really gone. She would not even risk
waiting outside to hear the result, but in generous gratitude at
her escape, she hoped he would at least secure the maiden heifer.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of Will still at his post suggested to her with a little
qualm that he was not so wrong: these male environments were
not without their drawbacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those horses seem to fascinate you,” she said, with a little
tremor in her voice. Whether Will or the violence just done to
her was the cause of it, she did not quite know. But her mood
was melting and her eye the brighter for a soft moisture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how was Will to follow her vagaries and adventures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my business,” he answered gruffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it was mine,” she laughed. She was quite prepared
now to make it a joint affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know my opinion on that,” he said icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t changed it yet?” she bantered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what should happen in these few minutes to make me
change it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things do happen in a few minutes,” she said mysteriously.
“Why, I might have come back and bought up the whole show.”
She waved her horn comprehensively over the horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What rubbish you do talk!” he said impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I?” She fired up. “There’s others think differently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they think differently, it’s because they think lightly of
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lightly, indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—they do. To drag you into an indecent sale-room!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indecent?” She flushed, wondering if Will had seen that
circumambient arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all indecent—all that talk about heifers. I don’t
wonder you blush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, relieved. “I’m blushing for you. You do talk
such rubbish!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you go with your cheek!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only what you just said to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said it because you do talk rubbish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you talk rubbish in saying it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, go to those who talk sense, Miss Boldero!” And he
pulled out his pipe and matches with a symbolic gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an obstinate creature you are, Will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me obstinate! Why, ain’t it your obstinacy that keeps you
here, when I’m ready to do your job?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you I preferred to do my own jobs.” And with that
she went straight up to the black hackneys, and while Will
puffed volcanically, she learnedly examined their teeth through
tear-misted eyes that saw neither incisors nor age-marks. Then,
after carefully prodding their ribs and punching and poking them
about, as she had seen purchasers do with bullocks, she swept
haughtily towards the auction arena, but afraid of encountering
the farmer, she hovered uncertainly on the threshold, feeling like
a bundle of straw between two donkeys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually she realized, and with enhanced resentment, that
<span class='it'>she</span> was the donkey; that both these men had deceived her in
representing the cattle-arena as the selling-place for the horses.
By the crowd that began to accumulate round the horses, and to
blot out the patient sentinel, as the hour for their sale approached,
it became plain that they would be sold where they were tied,
and presently the motley crowd, swollen by many of the cattle-auctioneer’s
audience, thrilled with the coming of this heavy-jowled worthy,
who had not turned a hair of his neatly combed
chevelure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The biddings were not brisk. To Jinny’s joy only the heavier
animals, the plough-horses and the cart-horses, seemed in demand;
the cobs and the ponies went for a song. The sable steeds she
had selected as the only suitable ones came late—most of the
animals had been released from their staples and led off by their
new masters. To her dismay the hackneys were put up as a
pair, and all her pride seemed falling into ruin. Fortunately, not
provoking a bid, they were then put up separately, and Jinny
set the ball rolling for the first with a brazen offer of ten pounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment she thought gleefully that the horse was to be
hers at that—for nobody there seemed in quest or in need of
carriage horses—but under the auctioneer’s scoff a few bargain-hunters
soon raised it to twenty, and then to Jinny’s alarm—for
her margin was getting dangerously narrow—to twenty-four.
At twenty-five the bargain-hunters fell off, and a new voice
intervened—a husky voice that seemed to mean business, and
whose every counter-bid filled her with dismay. At its twenty-eight
pounds the auctioneer still upheld his stick with scorn and
incredulity. She was almost at her bids’ end. “Twenty-nine
pounds,” she cried crushingly. This time the voice seemed
indeed silenced. She fully expected the stick to fall. But at
the first “Going,” though there had been no sound, the auctioneer
cried cheerily, “Thirty pounds.” Evidently somebody else had
nodded or held up a finger. Inflamed by the fever of the
struggle, she was impelled to risk even her own earnings, if
Flippance would not go so far. “Thirty-one pounds,” she cried
ringingly. “Thirty-one pounds,” echoed the auctioneer with a
promising accent of finality. “Thirty-two pounds,” he added
instantly, and this silent competition was even more crushing
than the huskiest bid. It put out her flame of recklessness, and
her heart sank with the stick, as despite all the auctioneer’s
derisory deprecation, that wooden finger of fate fell finally at
this truly absurd figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the name of the unseen silent buyer transpired. “Mr.
William Flynt!” proclaimed a familiar voice. A blaze of
positive hatred ran through all Jinny’s being. The brute! The
obstinate pig! To come interfering with her daily work, with
her bread and butter! To ride his will roughshod over hers!
And not only roughrider, but coward, sneak, traitor! Had he
not wormed and wheedled out of her the limit of her commission
and thus romped in, an easy winner! And he would take his
purchase to Mr. Flippance, she supposed. Yes, he was already
paying in full—she saw him now, near one of the clerks, drawing
a pocket-book out of the region of his black heart; he was in a
hurry, he would hasten with the animal to Tony Flip. But not
so fast, O dashing young man from Canada! Flippance is a man
of honour, he will repudiate the purchase. And the second
hackney still remains. The biter is bit—the pit you have digged
shall engulf you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what was Jinny’s horror and indignation when this young
man from Canada, now shamelessly revealed, instead of going
off with his spoil to Mr. Flippance, remained and ran up the
second horse with his serpent’s tongue at still greater speed, as
now cocksure of her limit. This time in her fury she ventured
as far as thirty-five—it was useless. With a recklessness still
more magnificent he cried “Forty,” and with a chill at her
heart in curious contrast with the glow of hate at it, she felt
that all was over. Was it of any use bidding even for the few
mediocre animals still possible? Would not this brutal monopolist
buy up the whole bunch—even as <span class='it'>she</span> had, oddly enough,
hinted a few minutes before about doing? Yes, there was nothing
his masterful obstinacy would boggle at in its resolve to crush
her will. He still stood by the horse-enclosure in unrelaxed
vigilance. Before she could arrive at any decision, her mind
was still further unhinged by the simultaneous appearance of
Nip and the advent of pandemonium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether it was Nip that had produced the pandemonium, or
the pandemonium that had liberated Nip, Jinny never knew. The
fact was, however, that Farmer Gale, waking to find himself
outbidden for the heifer and disappointed of his maiden, had
retreated fuming to his trap, and hearing Nip’s revolutionary
yaps for freedom in the adjacent cart, had loosed him out of
some vague instinct of malice—kindness he called it to himself,
so unacknowledged was his desire to thwart the will of the
creature’s mistress. A final kick administered to the retreating
jump—also apparently as a kindly encouragement to the freed
dog’s progress—had not proved conducive to the equilibrium of
an animal already deranged by a long-iterated grievance and an
unexpected freedom, and his helter-skelter pelt through the
market-place not unnaturally startled the nerves of not a few
fellow-quadrupeds, already shaken by the strange journeyings
and novel experiences of the day. But it was not until the
sheep were reached, that Nip’s passing became a public episode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had even before been numberless difficult scenes with the
sold lots; the effort to muster them for their new journeyings
had sufficiently taxed the lungs and tempers of men and sheep-dogs.
When Nip appeared, the normally stolid Master Peartree
was waving a giant red handkerchief and screaming wildly, while
demented-seeming drovers, formed into a half-ring, danced and
shrieked like savages at a religious service, and waved sticks
with a ritual air, and the sheep-dog leapt round and round,
chevying the flock in the desired direction. In this delicate
crisis, Nip’s rush of recognition at Master Peartree proved the
last straw. One super-terrified wether threw the flock into a
panic. The sheep rushed to and fro and everywhere (save where
the sticks and shrieks pointed); and going thus everywhere,
they went nowhere, jumping on and over one another’s backs
as in a game of leap-lamb. Some darted back into alien pens,
and the sheep-dog, itself distracted, leapt from back to back of
these, baying and menacing with feverish futility. It was like a
stormy sea of sheep, in which man was tossed about as in a
tempest. There were sheep standing on their hind legs as if
dancing, there were men clinging on to these legs or to tails or
to rumps, and pushing, pulling, and wrestling with them, but
never ceasing to yell and chevy. Finally a rescue party appeared
with a five-barred gate, which they moved this way and that,
striving to cut off at least one of the ways of escape. But this
only drove more sheep back into the wrong pens, where they
seemed hopelessly mixed up with lots still unsold. Jinny had
never imagined sheep such lively and individual lunatics. Now
the intruders were being dragged out by the wool of the head or
the rump, or half-carried, or wholly kicked; again the five-barred
gate was brought into play, this time to keep them away
from the pens, and then, wherever the eye turned, were these
tempestuous billows of sheep. They bounded, reared, wrestled,
danced, pranced, flew wildly at tangents: some escaped towards
the town, and everywhere men screamed, scurried, bellowed,
waved hands, or brandished sticks. Nip, his head equally lost,
seemed to be doing every one of these things at once, whether
ovine or human. And Jinny, in her anxiety to capture him, to
remove him, unseen, from the Witches’ Sabbath she feared he
had called into being, forgot all about the other possible, if
inferior, horses. By the time she had refastened Nip and
returned to the sale, the stick had fallen for the last bid. She
was just in time to see Will springing on one barebacked steed,
and leading his beribboned brother by a cord. And despite all
her anger and contempt, she could not avoid a thrill of admiration
for the grace of his poise and the fearlessness of his carriage.
And a dull aching pain began at her heart. She felt she wanted
something; she had missed getting something—and obscurely
she told herself it was the horses he was leading away. Yes, as
a Carrier she was a failure.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly the jovial figure of the Showman panted
into view. His face was unshorn, unwashed even, although
abundantly irrigated with perspiration, and he wore a low-crowned
vast-brimmed hat and an unseasonable fur-lined cloak
reaching almost to his slippers and fastened at the neck by a
brass buckle. Although Jinny always had a soft place in her
maternal heart for Mr. Flippance, nobody could have been more
unwelcome at this moment of her professional humiliation. But
before she could confess her failure, Tony Flip gasped out: “A
horse! A horse! My kingdom not to have it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I too late? Have you bought it yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet!” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” He grasped effusively at her hand, but
encountering the horn first, shook that instead, without apparently
noticing the difference. “Just as I woke up, it popped
into my nut that this was the morning of the cattle fair. Out
of bed I flew like from that bed in the Crystal Palace that chucks
you out by a spring, and though I mayn’t have beat the half-mile
record, I’m beat myself! Whew! Not a bad gag, that!”
And mopping his brow, he grinned through a grimy handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you looked odd,” said Jinny, equally relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know my collar’s a rag. But better sweat than debt,
eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not your collar—it’s seeing you out of your dressing-gown
at this hour!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a quiz, that’s what you are,” laughed Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind! That cloak comes nigh it, and you’ve still
got your carpet slippers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I? O Lord! I thought the road was feeling hard.
Is that a bar I see before me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” said Jinny severely. “But while you’re still sober,
perhaps you will tell me why you’ve changed your mind about
the horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’ve done with marionettes. I’m going back to the
legitimate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was puzzled. “To your wife, do you mean? I thought
she was dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony roared with laughter. “You little country mouse!
And yet you’re right. The legitimate is the missus I should
never have left—the drama with a big D. I don’t mean the
drama with swear words—ha, ha, ha! but the real live article.
You see, Duke and me, we’ve agreed to swop back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for? Why, that’s just the trouble. For a consideration,
says that son of a horse-leech. And I say that’s blood-sucking.
Good idea! Why shouldn’t you be arbitrator?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word, which was unfortunately absent from the Spelling-Book,
suggested nothing to her but being hanged, drawn, and
quartered, like a rebel whom Gran’fer had once seen executed.
But she was afraid of being again set down as a country mouse,
so she replied cautiously: “I haven’t the time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll pay you your time. Yes, you’d be the ideal arbitrator,”
cried Mr. Flippance, catching fire at his own idea. “To
begin with, you know nothing about it. So that’s settled, and
you shall drive me to Duke’s caravan this very morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if I have to wait for your drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The way you drive a man not to drink is awful,” he groaned.
“Never mind. I’ve got cool again. Talking to you is as good
as a drink. Guardian angel!” He squeezed her horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he narrated, as they drove townwards, “Duke
turned up here with the Flippance Fit-Up on Saturday night, and
struck an awful frost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he told me,” said Jinny. “I met him yesterday when I
came out of chapel, and I told him what a roaring trade you
were doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My preserver! Then it’s to you I owe it he’s hankering for
his own show back again! Not that he could expect to do any
business in my own town, or indeed any other. He forgot that
while I, unseen, can be Duke, the public won’t look at him for
a moment as Flippance. He takes the name of Flippance in
vain—the public knows the difference between a barnstormer
and their own Tony. To say nothing of that mincing little
Duchess after my full-throated, full-bosomed Polly. Poor dear
Polly—pining away pulling strings!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, she told me,” said the astonished Jinny, “that she
wouldn’t go back on the stage for all the treasures of the Crystal
Palace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that’s her unselfishness—bless her!—her own crystal
soul. She knows how the stage tries her pa’s nerves. But
haven’t I stood by her side as we jogged the figures and seen her
poor phiz working at the thought of being cut off from her public
like in a diving-bell? She takes things hard, does Polly, not
like the Duchess, who’s got no more temperament than a tinned
sardine. You’ve seen her, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you mean Mrs. Duke, she was with him yesterday. A
pretty, blue-eyed woman, with golden hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is it golden this season? But have you seen her act, I
mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never seen a play at all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut, tut, tut! Then you’ve never seen Me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—you seem to me a play all the time,” she said candidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not displeased. “Then you do have an idea what a
play is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen <span class='it'>Punch and Judy</span>—and the Christmas mummers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “Well, if Polly was working <span class='it'>Punch and Judy</span>
from behind, there’d be more life and go in her than there is to
the Duchess when she’s on the stage playing Juliet. The public
won’t pay to see a china doll. But my Polly! I tell you that
standing with the strings in her hand, with nobody’s eye on her
but mine and her Maker’s, and in a space where there isn’t room
to swing a cat, I’ve seen that girl raging and shouting and tearing
about with the passion of the scene till I’ve had to wake up too,
and we’ve gone at it ding-dong, hammer and tongs. And with
three figures each to work, and voices to keep changing, it’s no
mean feat, I can tell you. Duke and his Duchess now, when
they worked the figures, used to just stand like stocks, saying
the words, no expression or movement, except in the marionettes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if the public sees only the marionettes——!” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flippance shook his head. “There’s no art in cold blood.
Not that marionette art hasn’t got its own special beauties, and
I freely admit that in puppetry proper I’m not in it with Duke,
who was born into the business, and who cut and fitted the
figures himself. Lazy though you think me, how I’ve sweated
to get those things right! What an ungrateful swine the public
can be for one’s pearls!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of pearls?” asked Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, when a character takes up a glass of wine, for instance,
and drinks it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I shouldn’t applaud that,” laughed Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are!” he said with gloomy triumph. “The
public can’t see the cleverness of it. But if you remember the
delicacy it takes to manipulate the figure from behind, to make
it clutch the glass just right, instead of pawing the air, to make
that glass come accurately to the mouth, you’ll see the countless
chances against perfection. Talk of the corkscrew equilibrist at
Astley’s! Why, Jinny, when that glass sets itself down again
without accident, there ought to be applause to make the welkin
ring. But not a hand, not a hand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but it can’t seem very wonderful from the front,” said
Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would if people had brains to think. For every joint in
the human body there’s a joint in Duke’s marionette, and for
every joint in Duke’s marionette there’s a separate string to
pull. Every art has its own ideal, and for a puppet to sit down
safely is a greater success than for a Kean to play Shylock.
Though, of course, all this must be Greek to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when I’m thinking of the <span class='it'>fun</span> of <span class='it'>Punch and Judy</span>,” said
Jinny shrewdly, “I can’t think of the cleverness of the showman
pulling the strings—otherwise I should forget the figures weren’t
alive, nor the story real—the two things contradict one another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove! I think you’ve hit it,” said Mr. Flippance, more
gloomily than ever. “They take the standard of drama—not
of mechanical miracles. And that’s why they applaud most at
the easiest effects, just shouting and blood and thunder, and
that’s why I’m sick, I mean, why Polly is sick of the whole
business. Take our tight-rope dancer now. I don’t say she’s as
graceful as a live dancer at Richardson’s, or pirouettes like the
Cairo Contortionist of my young days at Vauxhall. But she’s
far more wonderful. A live tight-rope dancer can, after all, only
fall downwards if she makes a slip. But ours, instead of tumbling
down, might fly up like a balloon, or even just miss the tight-rope
and dance on nothing like you see a murderer at Newgate. But
the public take the standard of the ballet or the queens of the
tight-rope, and instead of giving us a hand for the cleverness in
the making and dressing of the puppet, and another hand for
the putting life into it, and a third hand for the dexterity of the
manipulation, there’s times when we get no more recognition
than if ’twas a monkey-on-a-stick. I tried to educate ’em by
letting ’em see the strings or the wires—I mustn’t tell an outsider
what they are exactly—I flooded my stage with light.
Duke, now, used to keep his scene particularly dark with the
<span class='it'>fantoccini</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s fantokeeny?” asked Jinny, imitating his mispronunciation
as best she could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re the figures that are more mechanism than character—balancers,
pole-carriers, stilt-walkers, spiral ascensionists, and
this tight-rope dancer I’m telling you of. Duke’s idea was to keep
the mechanism dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That seems to me best,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t agree,” said Mr. Flippance. “There’s the scenic
effects to consider. Darken your scene and you hide it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if you light it, you show up the way it’s done,” Jinny
urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless you show ’em the way it’s done, how can they appreciate
the way you do it? But there, I’m done with it! Let
Duke have his pony. Polly shall tread the boards once more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he want you to give him a pony then to change back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, the son of a Shylock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you will want a horse after all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pony—you little innocent—means twenty-five pounds. I
suppose, though, that’s about the value of a pony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It depends who’s bidding against you,” said Jinny ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyhow, that’s what the bloodsucker wants—the
twenty-five pounds he gave me he wants back again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if he gave it you, why isn’t it fair to give it back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! You’re beginning to arbitrate, are you? Well, then!
It isn’t fair because I get back the Flippance Fit-Up tarnished
and depreciated by the performances of that howling amateur
and his squeaking doll of a Duchess. Besides, I don’t want the
‘Fit-Up’ particularly, only my trade-mark back, the world-famous
word, Flippance, for I am going to stay the whole year
here in Chipstone—you see what lots of people there are on
market days—-Mother Gander’s buying a bigger hall for you
Peculiars—haven’t you heard?—and me and Charley have
worked it with her to sell me the old chapel. I’ll easily get it
mortgaged, licensed, knocked into shape, and enlarged—that
piece of ground between the gate and the doors is wasted at
present, and there’s an American capitalist keen to come in—I
met him just now riding a black horse and leading another—and
what better omen could man desire? The Flippance Palace I
shall call my theatre—suggests the Hyde Park success, d’ye see?
And when that Crystal show is over—it won’t run beyond
October—I’ll have the Queen’s elephant standing in my lobby!
Lord, it’ll draw all Essex! Chipstone’ll become the capital!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These sudden pieces of information left Jinny gasping. The
old chapel thus whisked away from under her feet, and turned
into a gigantic Punch-and-Judy show sent her world reeling;
while Will, transformed into a theatre proprietor, seemed rapt
away to unimaginable heights—or depths. But she did not
quite believe it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what does Miss Flippance say?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Polly? She’ll be off her nut with joy. Why, she’s such a
glutton for work, is that girl, that when we played <span class='it'>The Mistletoe
Bough</span> she used to play Lady Agnes in Act I and her spirit in
Act II (after she’s killed by being shut up in the box, you
know), and actually double the part with that of her maid, Maud,
who has two quick changes from jacket and petticoat to tunic
and trunks, and back again to bodice and skirt, not to mention
slipping to and fro ’twixt spirit and flesh. She’s pining away to
a spirit herself, poor dear, for lack of her real work. Only we
mustn’t break it to her before the deed is done—or rather signed.
The poor girl would insist on sacrificing herself. But after all
I’ve saved thirty pounds—you realize I won’t need a horse now—so
even if I pay him twenty-five, I make a fiver. Not a bad
morning’s work, eh, my dear? We’ll get a good stock company
and give ’em everything from the Bard to burletta, and I’ve got
some lovely ideas for taking plays out of Mr. Dickens’s novels.
Oh, we’ll wake up the old place. Charley knows some local girls
that would come in splendidly for ballets and choruses, and
there’s a wonderful scene-painter, too, down here—a chap I
knew at the ‘Eagle’ in London—he’s lost his job and come
down to his folks to get cured—his hand shakes a bit still, but
he’s a marvel, I promise you, the days he’s not sewn up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accepting this synonym for intoxication as referring to the
medical operations upon the unfortunate artist, Jinny received
the statement with an admiring commiseration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And haven’t you got a friend, a wonderful expert in costumes?”
Tony rattled on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me?” she murmured, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sort of bearded lady from a French convent, a cranky old
Catholic who talks with angels, but is a dab all the same at dressmaking——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean Miss Gentry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the name. We’ll appoint her wardrobe mistress.”
Never had Jinny known him so happy and gaseous—and, paradoxically
enough, the more he poured out, the more inflated
he got!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Gentry’ll never enter a theatre,” said Jinny assuredly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see. Wardrobe Mistress to the Flippance Palace,
Chipstone. Think how that will improve her billheads! And
there’s you, too! Why should you waste a first-class stage
presence on carrying? You carry yourself too well for that,
eh? Ha, ha, ha! A thinking part, perhaps, to begin with, but
with your good speaking voice——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Jinny had encountered the full shock of this new proposition,
Mr. Flippance broke off and besought her frenziedly to
drive down a side street. As she obeyed, she realized that they
had just escaped Polly—though a Polly hardly recognizable in
that houri in white, creamily jacketed, bonneted, gloved, and,
above all, veiled, whom only her massive tread betrayed as
charmless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” explained Polly’s pa, “it doesn’t do to argue with
women you’re fond of: you’ve just got to do what’s best for ’em.
Duke now, he’s very weak with women: ’twixt you and I, he
only got my Fit-Up because the Duchess, tired of working in the
dark and of blushing unseen, wanted to show off what you call
her blue eyes and golden hair. She tried pulling his strings—see?—and
he, having no backbone, jigged about at her pleasure.
But now, to my thinking, Duke’s found out what a fool she’s
made of him and of herself, too. For, of course, she’s mucked
up his business. Polly mayn’t be a Venus, but she’s stunning in
her make-ups—I assure you such a great artist is that woman,
that seeing her standing in the wings at the first dress rehearsal,
I’ve more than once fallen in love with her myself—till, of
course, she opened her mouth. Yes, Polly can always have blue
eyes and golden hair, but the Duchess will never have talent if
she rehearses till doomsday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then is Mr. Duke satisfied to go back to the illegitimate?”
asked Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at the word. “To the marionettes? That’s
what Duke wants the twenty-five pounds for,” he answered.
“He’s lost heavily, and he’ll be able to show her a <span class='it'>quid pro quo</span>—or
rather twenty-five of ’em—ha, ha, ha! All the same, we’d
better not talk business if the Duchess happens to be at home.
She may have her hand too tight on his strings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what shall we do if she’s in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall only say I’ve looked in to congratulate her on her
successes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Jinny was seriously shocked, and Mr. Flippance,
realizing that her conscience was as “country” as her vocabulary,
had the shrewdness to say he was only joking. “Besides,” he
added, “she’s sure not to be at home in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because she won’t have her hair on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could she go out then without it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony made as if to pinch her cheek, as if nothing else could
adequately express his acute sense of her simplicity, but she
guarded deftly with the horn; rapping him, indeed, on the
knuckles with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Jinny, you hurt me,” he said ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, remember I’m not a marionette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re certainly not a woman of the world. The Duchess
wouldn’t let us in, I mean, but that’s just what we want, provided
we can get Duke to exit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another minute or two she drove him up to the back of
“The Learned Pig,” and alighting, they picked their way
through the undulating and muddy enclosure, grass-grown, and
strewn with logs, where the caravan was stationed. There was
really a pig there (duly styed in his very dirty academy), besides
pecking poultry and pathetic rabbit-hutches agleam with eager
sniffing noses, and a flutter of washing, and two shabby traps,
holding up their shafts like beggars’ arms. But the caravan
itself illumined the untidy space with its gay green paint, its
high yellow wheels, its spick-and-span air, culminating in the
lace curtain of its tiny arched window. Mr. Flippance dragged
his slippers up the step-ladder, and Jinny, having by this time
gathered what an arbitrator was, followed in his wake, prepared
to undertake this or any other job.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Duchess did let them in—more, she opened the door
herself, looking indeed too lovely for anything but a doll, and
suggesting by her rising and falling eyelids, her smiling lips, and
her mobile hands that she was equipped with all the most
expensive devices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Duke, habited in an old-fashioned blue coat with brass buttons,
was discovered poring at a desk over a long, narrow account
book: he was an elderly and melancholy young man, with
bristly black-and-white hair and small pig-eyes set close together.
The stamp of aspiration and defeat was set pathetically upon the
sallow face he turned over his shoulder to his visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was not edified by Mr. Flippance’s pretence that she—Jinny—was
the sole ground for the visit. She had, he said,
been driving him home from the market, where he had gone to
dispose of a horse, and he had taken the liberty of bringing her
to see their “wonderful” caravan, finding, to his amazement,
that she had never been inside. For once the stock Essex
epithet was justified—it was indeed a “wonderful” caravan,
and the interior so took up her attention that for some time she
failed to follow the conversation, though she had a dim uneasy
sense that it continued—as it began—with scant regard to the
ethics of the Spelling-Book. The gay paint and the neat lace
curtains had prepared her for an elegance, and even an airiness,
that were not to be found within the caravan. But little else
seemed lacking. For into this cramped wheeled chamber,
looking scarce larger than her own cart, and certainly not so
large as Commander Dap’s cabin in the Watch Vessel, was
packed not only a complete cottage with its parlour, living-room,
bedroom, scullery, and kitchen, but the mantelpieces and chests
of drawers were as crowded with china dogs and shepherdesses
as Blackwater Hall itself, besides a wealth of pictures, objects
of art, posters, and inhabited birdcages, to which Daniel Quarles’s
domain could lay no claim. Not that there was really more
than one undivided space, or that you could tell where one room
ended and the other began. Nevertheless, all the different
sections were clearly visible, though a square yard here or there
did double or treble service, forming part of this or that room
according as you looked at it. Most clearly marked, of course,
was the bedroom, consisting of a raised, neatly counterpaned bed,
like an upper berth in a ship, and a chest of drawers topped with
ornaments, though the kitchen with its grate and oven and
flap-table ran it close, in every sense of the phrase. Amid these
poky surroundings, the Duchess’s blue eyes and golden hair
shone so sunnily and veraciously—taken unawares as she seemed—that
Jinny, ignorant she was expecting a visitor, felt that Mr.
Flippance was as unjust of judgment as he was loose of statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But an interior so foreign to her experience affected her with
all the pleasurable interest of drama, apart from the comedy of
which she felt it to be the setting, as, awaking again to the
conversation, she heard the two males still keeping it carefully
away from the negotiation pending between them, and evidently
hard exercised—despite gin from an improbable corner cupboard—to
keep the ball of nothingness rolling. Painful silences fell,
which a linnet and a goldfinch mule strove loyally to fill, but
which remained so awkward that she herself was constrained to
enter into the conspiracy, though only by way of genuine admiration.
Admiration of the caravan—a ready-made thing that went
with Duke—was by no means, however, the admiration the
Duchess wanted, and as she failed to extract it from poor Mr.
Flippance, fidgeting under Jinny’s Puritan eye, she fell back on
a tribute of her own to herself, recounting tediously the triumphs of
her tour, and calling on her partner for corroboration, which he
supplied in joyless monosyllables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All Flippance’s interjections with a view to stem the stream
and divert the conversation to a pretext for Duke’s exit with
him were like straws tossed before a torrent. But presently
there came relief—though the plot thickened, Jinny felt. There
was a sound of footsteps on the ladder, and, “Ah, there’s Polly!”
the monologist broke off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Jinny was already steeped in a sense of the dramatic, if,
stimulated by the novel setting, she had begun to feel that in
such cross-currents and mutual deceptions must lie the substance
of that unknown article of commerce these people lived by—a
play—how strongly was this intuition confirmed and this sense
enhanced when Mr. Flippance, whispering in apparent facetiousness,
“I’m in my slippers—she’ll rag me,” kicked them off under
a chair, slid back mahogany panels below the bed, disclosing
a lower berth, and tumbled in, with his finger roguishly on his
lips, closing the panels from within!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The Mistletoe Bough!</span>” he sibilated. So there it was! They
were actually imitating a play before her very eyes. Duke and
the Duchess, grinning, drew the panels tighter. The theatre was
so in their blood, Jinny felt, that these things came as natural
to them as carrying to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was thus that Jinny saw her first farce—unless the high
tragedy of <span class='it'>Punch and Judy</span> be degraded by that name.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Polly, it soon transpired, was come to the midday dinner with
her friend, and the dinner itself was coming in presently from
“The Learned Pig.” The real purpose of the invitation was, it
transpired equally, that Polly might explain to the Duchess the
reading of a part alleged to be confused in the manuscript
acquired with the Flippance Fit-Up: she was obviously fishing
for tips. While these things were transpiring, poor Flippance in
his fur was perspiring. Gradually Jinny saw a rift appearing in the
bed-panels and widening to a cautious chasm of a few inches. It
made her feel choky herself, especially as the caravan’s little
window was closed. She signed apprehensively to Mr. Duke,
who, however, was already revolving feverishly how to clear the
stage for himself and his fellow-negotiator. And presently he
broke into the feminine dialogue with, “I’m sure, dearest, Polly
wouldn’t mind acting that bit for you. But there ain’t room for
Polly’s genius here—she’d be breaking up the happy home!
Hadn’t you better go into the inn-parlour, Bianca? There’ll be
nobody there yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duchess might have lacked talent, but she had not played
in farces without learning how to behave in them: so without
even needing a wink from her spouse, she made a kindly exit
behind Polly, not, however, without turning back a grinning
doll’s head at Mr. Flippance’s beaded countenance emerging
gaspingly from his berth. But Jinny, who had already witnessed
comedy and farce, was now more conscious of the tragedy of the
situation than of its humours, as she saw the Duchess tripping
down the ladder, with silken stockings revealed by the raised
skirt. It seemed to Jinny that the poor lady was tripping thus
blithely to her dark doom, behind the scenes of the puppet show;
that her blue eyes and golden hair had flaunted their last upon
the stage. And the irony of her grinning exit was accented by
the manuscript in her hand: she was going off to study a part
she would nevermore play. It all gave Jinny a sense of the
Duchess being herself a puppet, with an ironic fate pulling the
strings, and she was frightened by a thought hitherto beyond
the reach of her soul; by a dim feeling that perhaps she too—and
everybody else—was similarly mocked. Who was perpetually
jerking her towards that young man, and then jerking
her back? What force was always putting into her mouth
words of fleer and flout, and pulling away the hand she yearned
to lay in his?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” exclaimed Mr. Anthony Flippance, as Jinny shut
the door safely on the Duchess—for that lady never shut doors,
partly because the process interfered with the sweep of one’s
exit, partly because what concerned a scene from which she was
absent never entered her golden head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” repeated Mr. Flippance, scrambling out. “I know
now what Lady Agnes felt like. ‘<span class='it'>Help, Lovel!—Father, help!—I
faint—I die—Oh! Oh!</span>’ But I’m disappointed in Polly,”
he added, diving under a chair. “Fancy being all her life on
the stage, and not espying these slippers!” He dug his feet
into them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no time for joking,” said Duke anxiously, as he
tugged open the drawer of a desk in his “parlour.” “I suppose
Jinny is in the know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny’s come as arbitrator!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” Duke wheeled round, his hair still more on end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get on with your mystery-desk. It stands to reason a
runaway financial imagination like yours needs a brake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t you brake enough?” Mr. Duke’s tone was bitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you want me to be broke!” retorted Tony. “I give
you my beautiful marionettes, life-sized and life-painted, all
carved by the best maker——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know all about that!” interrupted Duke impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re not going to deny your own skill, I hope?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Duke glared impotently with his little pig-eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with the costliest costumes,” Tony went on blandly.
“And all these puppets moreover with the latest mechanical
contrivances, regardless of expense——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t I give you the finest goodwill in East Anglia,”
burst in Mr. Duke, “the Flippance Fit-Up with all its plays,
prestige, and unique takings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing at a time, old cock. Packed into a box that itself
opens out and forms part of the stage, combining portability of
props with——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do dry up!” cried the maddened Duke. “If you’re not
quick, Bianca will be back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that to me? To cut it short, I give you the finest
marionette show in the world, with scenery, sky-borders, and
plays complete, and an old-established reputation, a show that
has played before the crowned heads of Europe, America, and
Australia, and, like the workhouse boy in Mr. Dickens’s book,
you ask for more. What say <span class='it'>you</span>, Jinny? Thinkest thou the
Duke should have more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all want more,” said Jinny. “Air! Mayn’t I open the
window?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, excuse me.” Mr. Duke, evidently trained by his big
doll, rushed to do it. “But haven’t I lost enough without losing
my twenty-five pounds too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned back to his desk, and extricating from its remoter
recesses another large narrow fat account book—the twin of that
he had been poring over—held it up theatrically. “Here’s my
marionette accounts for sixteen years—look through ’em and see
if you can find any single week—ay, even the week of King
William’s funeral—as low as the best of the weeks since I touched
your wretched show.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My wretched show!” Mr. Flippance lost his blandness.
“Why, if that’s the case, it’s you that have depreciated it. <span class='it'>You</span>
ought to pay <span class='it'>me</span> compensation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Duke had dramatically dumped the book down side by
side with its twin. “Look on this picture and on that!” he
said. “Duke’s Marionettes, week ending March 10th, 1849,
Colchester. Total, £23 18s. 10d. Flippance Fit-Up, Colchester
Corn Exchange, week ending March 8th, 1851. Monday.
Eleven shillings. <span class='it'>There’s</span> an opening! Tuesday——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come to the d——d total!” said Tony impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t any total,” said Duke crushingly. “Tuesday,
sixteen shillings and sixpence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always rising, you see!” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wednesday,” Duke went on implacably, “nine shillings and
fourpence——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how do you get fourpence?” interrupted Tony
severely. “You haven’t been letting down the prices, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s noted at the side. See!” said the careful Duke. “A
swindler passed off a groat as a tanner. Thursday, Eight and
sixpence—imagine the Colchester Corn Exchange with eight and
sixpence! Friday. Nine shillings——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rising again, you see,” chirruped Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saturday. One pound thirteen and six.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are! That pulls you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saturday evening,” concluded Duke. “Two pounds eight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then he grumbles!” Mr. Flippance raised his great
ringed hands towards Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Total, six pounds five and tenpence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And isn’t that enough to live on?” cried Tony. “Only two
in family and a little bird or so! And if your box-office man had
been smart enough to tell a groat from a tester, you’d have had
six guineas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wasn’t such a fool,” said Duke dryly, “for on another
night it’s noted that a half-sovereign was passed off on him for
sixpence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then you outrage Providence by complaining of the
takings,” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rent of Corn Exchange,” continued Duke doggedly, “three
guineas. Salaries (to company, including check-taker), four
pounds eight. Lighting, a pound. Advertising (including bill-poster),
three pounds ten——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear chap, what extravagance! No wonder——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Travelling expenses (company and scenery, excluding caravan),
eighteen and ninepence. Drinks to Pressmen—one and
sixpence——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not enough! No wonder——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Net deficit, seven pounds sixteen and threepence, <span class='it'>plus</span> the
salary of Bianca and me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Why, you said salary of company, four pounds
eight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t suppose I included ourselves with the check-taker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t? Oh, my dear fellow,” said Tony sympathetically,
“no wonder you’re down in the mouth. A wise manager
always pays his salary before any other expense; then he’s always
sure of a stand-by!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t the money that’s the worst,” Duke explained. “It’s
the dreadful loneliness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you stuff the house with paper and put up ‘Free
List Absolutely Suspended’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easier said than done in a place where you don’t know a
soul. Why, Bianca had a Benefit Night, and how many do you
think were in the stalls? Two women and a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve known only the theatre cat——” began Tony cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the boy went to sleep!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wasn’t it his bedtime? But I <span class='it'>will</span> say it’s not entirely the
fault of your acting. I’ve noticed ever since that Crystal Palace
loomed on the horizon, it’s unsettled the public within at least
fifty miles from Hyde Park. I was talking to a showman who
told me that in March and April this year business fell off everywhere—there
was no interest in giants, dwarfs, fat men, pig-faced
ladies, and even jugglers, animal magnetizers, lion-tamers, performing
elephants, ventriloquists, prestidigitators, and professors
of necromancy. Didn’t you hear of the fate of poor Wishbone, the
conjurer, at Chelmsford Fair? Not even a kid dropped into his
booth, so he went out to perform outside, but before he could
‘hey, presto!’ the purse back to the owner, the peeler copped
him. The magistrate wouldn’t listen to his patter, and he can’t
tap himself out of quod either, poor chap. Besides, we all
remember the awful weather in March, yes and up to the very
opening of the Crystal Palace—rain, rain, rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, take the March of 1849,” said Duke, turning back his
oblong pages, “and don’t forget people’ll sit in Assembly Rooms
or a Corn Exchange when they won’t risk a draughty tent. Now
look at the weather that year—when I pulled my own strings.
Tuesday, W.S.—that is, wet, snow. Wednesday, R.N. (rough
night). Thursday, S.H.T. (storm, hail, and thunder). Saturday,
W.T. (wind, tilt OFF!). Come now, you could hardly have a
worse week, could you? Everything except B.F.1 or B.F.2
(black fog or big funeral). Yet see, my takings for that week
were——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony flipped away the book with his jewelled hand. “What
you’ve got to compare with your Colchester week,” he said, “is
not your marionette week in March ’49, but my Fit-Up week for
that date.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It stands to reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They debated the point warmly: finally Tony referred it to
Jinny: that was what she was there for, he recalled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly think,” arbitrated the little Carrier, “that we
ought to see what Mr. Flippance’s live theatre could do in the
same weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well,” acquiesced Duke sulkily. “And what <span class='it'>did</span>
you do that week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens, man, how on earth can I remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But haven’t you got it written down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you take me for?” asked Tony. “A tradesman?
A bookkeeper? Unless Polly——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me the other Christmas that you averaged twenty-five,”
said Duke bitterly, “and I paid you one week’s takings
by way of douceur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then you do know my weekly takings,” said Tony
loftily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t stay here for ever,” put in Jinny. “I’ve got my
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m paying you, ain’t I?” Tony rebuked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not giving me work.” She assumed a judicial air. “Do
you, Mr. Flippance, maintain that your theatre is a more valuable
concern than Mr. Duke’s marionettes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said the young Solomon in petticoats, “surely if you
get it back, you ought to pay him the difference in value.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo! Bravo!” Mr. Duke’s little pig-eyes gleamed.
“A sensible girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny!” groaned Mr. Flippance: “To desert your old
pal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you, Mr. Duke,” went on Jinny imperturbably,
“maintain that your marionettes are a better property than the
Flippance Fit-Up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not,” said Mr. Duke, not to be caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The marionettes are a worse property then?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Duke banged his book. “Much worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do you want it back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony uttered a shriek of delight. “A Daniel come to judgment!
Oh, Jinny, I could hug you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sweep of her horn kept him at arm’s length. “You say, Mr.
Duke, that the Fit-Up property is the better, and yet you want
to give it up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Duke leaned his elbows on the desk, and dropped his head
in his hands. “You confuse me—I must have time to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hamlet!” observed Tony pleasantly. “But I don’t think
the ghost will walk.” His hand moved towards the gin decanter,
but again that baffling horn intervened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” said Duke, rummaging in his drawer. “I’ve
got the transfer written out, ready for signature, two copies—the
exact words of our last agreement, only turned the other way, of
course. I’m a plain man—is it to be or not to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the question,” said Tony sepulchrally. “But you
see it isn’t so plain as you. You’ve depreciated my theatre and
it’s not worth the extra pony. Why can’t you make a reasonable
compromise and just swap back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! And be a pony out of pocket?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be an elephant out of pocket if you don’t,” Jinny
reminded him. “Seven pounds sixteen and threepence a week
mount up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that was a particularly bad week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there <span class='it'>were</span> good weeks?” flashed Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you the best weren’t as good as the marionettes’ worst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, old cock, draw it mild!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t believe me,” said Duke, firing up, “look for
yourself! And what’s more, if you find I’m wrong, keep the
pony and be hanged to you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easy! Easy! But I was never a man to refuse a sporting
offer—tip us the tomes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Duke handed him the twin account books, but soon, tiring of
the rows of figures, Mr. Flippance begged Jinny to pursue the
investigation while he studied the document of transfer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not without a thrill that, setting the volumes on a
hanging flap that Duke had changed for her into a table, she went
back over the pages of faded ink that told of toils and tribulations
in the years before she had come into being: as a carrier she
was peculiarly sensitive to these records of wrecked tents and
ruined takings. Through the peace of the summer morning in
that poky caravan, the winds from that pre-natal period seemed
to be rushing, its snows falling, its hails and thunders crashing,
and with these imagined tempests came up the thought of Will.
What was he doing now, with his beautiful black horses? Was
he looking for Mr. Flippance at “The Black Sheep”? But the
thought of him was too agitating; she crushed it down and got
absorbed in her task and the tales the figures told: the blanks
carefully explained by Good Friday or royal mourning or the
journey to some distant pitch; the varying cost of these pitches
in publicans’ meadows; the varying expense of cartage; the
sudden jumps in the takings, due—as annotated—to high days
and holidays, or to royal weddings, or to favourite pieces. She
wondered why Mr. Duke ever played any others. “What is
D.F.N.?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dismissed. Fine night,” said Mr. Duke in melancholy
accents. It was the supreme tragedy. “<span class='it'>Although</span> a fine night,”
he explained, rubbing it in to himself, “not enough to be worth
playing to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t always do good business, you see,” gurgled Tony
from the gin-glass he had imperceptibly acquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accidents will happen,” Duke retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is D.S.?” put in Jinny. “Dismissed. Snow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D.S. is diddling show,” explained Duke gloomily. “I struck
one only last week at the very public-house I hired my pitch
from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wasn’t playing fair,” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed. They stuck a placard in the window, ‘Great
Water Otter. Free.’ And when you’d had your drink they
took you to the stables to see it in its tub. There were crowds
every night. It was put in the paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony grinned. “ ‘Lord, what fools these mortals be!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?” asked Jinny. “I’d rather see a water-otter
than a dancing doll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not even a country mouse,” said Tony. “When the
fools push and squeeze to get near the tub, they warn ’em, ‘Don’t
go too near!’ And all the while it’s only a big iron kettle—a
water-’otter. See!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s what they all do,” said Duke dismally. “Laugh
and help to gull the others. And between them the legitimate
goes to the dogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or the otters.” Jinny bent in lighter spirits over the twin
volumes. “I’m afraid you’ve lost, Mr. Flippance,” she
announced at last. “I can’t see any drama week of Mr. Duke’s
that goes as high as the worst of his marionette weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right you are!” said Tony, cheerful under his liquid.
“Sport is sport and the pony is yours. Here goes!” And
picking up a pen from the desk, he signed one of the documents
with a long thick line sweeping backward from his
final “e.” Duke signed the other copy more soberly, and
Jinny witnessed both signatures with careful calligraphy. “It
only remains, old cock,” said Tony, “to deliver the twenty-five
pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear, hear,” agreed Duke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t suppose I carry it about with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Duke’s face fell. “But without money passing, it ain’t
legal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I jumped out of bed in a hurry—Jinny’ll bear me out.
I mean,” he added hurriedly, as a dramatic interest flickered
across Duke’s face, “look at my slippers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve seen your stinking old slippers!” Duke was
getting unpleasant. “What I want to see is my money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, old boy—no use letting your dander rise—it’s a case
of H.G.I.—haven’t got it, and M.O.I.U.—must owe it you!
Still, I dare say we can rake up something on account, to make
a legal consideration. Doubtless Jinny has got half a crown.
Give me one, Jinny, till I get home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny, who had always hitherto dealt with Polly, and been
scrupulously paid, had no hesitation in handing him the coin.
She did not know it was the cost of her arbitration. Duke
accepted it ungraciously as earnest money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I may advise you how to run your own show, now
you’ve got it back,” said Tony handsomely, “don’t go so much
by the fairs. There’s not only the waste of time and travel in
between one and t’other, it’s lowering a fine art to the level of a
merry-go-round or the talking lobst——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t wait for ever,” interposed Jinny. “Are you coming?”
She opened the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your time’s paid,” said Mr. Flippance severely. “However,
Duke takes my meaning. Here’s luck to him!” And with a
last gulp at Duke’s gin, he followed her to the door. “Send me
my scenery and props and the same cart can take back yours
and the box of figures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” said Duke, “that’ll need several journeys or carts.
We divide the freightage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! When I throw in twenty-five pounds! O Duke,
Duke, if you ain’t careful there’ll be a show of the meanest man
on earth.” And shaking his fat jewelled forefinger waggishly at
the caravan proprietor, he followed the Carrier. “Now for a
last kick at the company,” he observed to her, as the door
closed upon the dismal Duke.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But at that moment the ground resounded with gallant hoofs,
and a handsome red-haired cavalier riding a barebacked black
horse and leading another steed of Satan, and followed by a
bounding little white dog, brought life and spirit into the scene.
The rabbits poked their noses greedily through their wires, and
the pig grunted in perturbation. Jinny, shrinking back behind
Mr. Flippance, remained paralysed on the steps of the caravan,
while Tony, unconscious that he was needed as a screen, hurried
forward with a joyous greeting and a query which served the
purpose as effectually, for Jinny was left unnoted on her
pedestal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You looking for me?” asked Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was,” answered the horseman. “But now I’m looking for
the stables. ‘The Black Sheep’s’ full up, and I thought I’d put
up my spare horse at ‘The Learned Pig’ till I could find you.
However, here you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you crossed me, man, just outside the market!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I? Is Jinny here? I see her cart outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind Jinny—you’re just in the nick of time. I want
to talk business to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so do I to you. If I crossed you, ’twas because I
was galloping to you with the horse you ordered through
Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I was galloping to her to cancel it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” cried Will. But the joyous rush and gambollings
of Nip now directed his attention to Nip’s statuesque
mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you’ve let yourself in for those horses,” she said,
descending. She did not speak maliciously—the sting of her
defeat was over, now that his victory had recoiled on the victor,
and she was really a little sorry for him. But all other feelings
were overwhelmed for the moment by this new sense of dash
and grace, in which he and the beautiful pawing steeds were
mixed up centaur-like, his figure looking so much taller on
horseback that it almost corresponded to Miss Gentry’s ideal.
Unfortunately Will himself had no sense of the horses except as
a costly and burdensome mistake: the iron issuing from Jinny’s
soul was entering into his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely you want one of ’em,” he said, addressing Mr.
Flippance. He had cherished a dim hope that the Showman
might launch out into binary grandeur, but at the worst he was
prepared to keep one horse—it would be useful for riding into
Chipstone—pending its sale. But to have two horses on his
hands, eating their heads off, after consuming practically the
whole of his capital—this was too much. Nor could he believe
that Jinny was not gloating over the Nemesis that had overtaken
his attempt to crush her will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see what I should do with a horse,” said Tony,
“seeing that I’m setting up the Flippance Palace Theatre as a
local landmark. Of course I might have a play written round
him,” he mused, “or even round ’em both. They would certainly
‘draw’ all Chipstone, especially with a carriage behind
’em. Odd, isn’t it? There’ll be scores of carriages waiting outside
my theatre, yet to see one on the stage gives everybody a thrill.
Lord, how the public does love to see natural things in unnatural
places! As my old pa used to say—my real pa, I mean—put
an idiot on the stage and he gives pleasure, put him in the stalls
and he writes dramatic criticism! Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you do want ’em?” said Will eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re ready to bring in the noble animals as part of the
capital, I’ll look around for a dramatist to work ’em in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d best look around for a capitalist,” retorted Will in
angry disappointment. “I’ve told you before, I’m going into
farming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll want the horses yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re no good for farming,” Jinny corrected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t they?” said Tony, surveying them with a fresh eye.
“Then why did he buy them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will got angrier. “That’s my business. Do you want them
or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can always do with anything. A play’s a pie you can
shove anything into. You’d look bully yourself, as you Americans
say, riding just as you are: just a cowboy costume, that’s all
you need. Will you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I do what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Play lead and supply your own horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a fool—or try to make me one. I’m a plain
farmer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony grinned. “Jinny don’t seem to think ’em suitable for
plain farming. I reckon you’d better set up as undertaker.
They’ll go lovely with a hearse. All you need is a corpse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shan’t be long finding one!” hissed Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony clapped his hands. “That’s the style. Lord, man,
what a wasted actor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny could not suppress a smile. It brought Will’s temper to
breaking-point. “These horses at least won’t be wasted,” he
said to her at a white heat. “For I’ll take our friend’s advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harness ’em to a hearse?” murmured Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, to a coach. I’ll put an end, miss, to your mannish
ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!” Jinny bridled up, without, however, quite
following the threat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve done for yourself,” he explained. “You’ve forced
me into competition. You’ve got me the horses—there’s no end
of out-of-work coaches on the market to be got for an old song.
I’ll carry passengers and luggage faster and cheaper than you,
and heavier stuff too, and I’ll wipe you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny grew white, but at the venom of his words, not their
business significance. Her instinct retorted with a smile. “And
I got you the horn, too, don’t forget that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t—I was thinking of that. It’s all your doing—and
serve you jolly well right.” He turned sneeringly to Mr. Flippance.
“So I won’t be a wasted musician either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho!” said Jinny. “And shall we see you on the box-seat
all a-crowing and a-blowing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you still think I can’t blow—but you shall see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Seeing</span> isn’t believing,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had you there, old cock,” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She knows what I mean, right enough. I’ll start a coach-service
’twixt Little Bradmarsh and Chipstone, ay and farther
too, passengers inside, luggage on the roof. I’ll wake up this
sleepy old spot.” And his vigour seemed to communicate itself
to his horses: they caracoled and stamped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better let sleeping spots lie,” said Jinny. “I thought you
hated Yankee going-ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll save <span class='it'>you</span> going ahead, anyhow,” said Will. “Why
didn’t you let things sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! How could I help helping Gran’fer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women have always got an excuse. ‘And the man gave
unto me and I did eat.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord! He’s been reading the Bible!” laughed Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will flushed. All those hours in quest of orthography passed
through his mind. And what had all his painstaking letters led to?
Quarrels, recriminations, miseries. Well, let him have done with
it all. Ignore her, crush her, that was the best way. Once he
had driven her out of the business, that tongue of hers would
wag more meekly. Then, perhaps——!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rousing blast on Jinny’s horn cut defiantly into his thoughts.
It was at once a challenge and a mockery. Will turned his
horses’ heads sharply and trotted out, Nip at their heels. But
at the edge of the enclosure Nip looked back wistfully to beg his
mistress to join the party. She, however, lowering her horn,
cried, “Come here, you naughty dog. Come here at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nip stood in pathetic hesitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s that animal my play shall be written round,” said Tony
decisively. “How much do you want for him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I wouldn’t, part with him for love or money,” said
Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I haven’t got any money,” said Tony slowly. “But
if you’d like the other thing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be silly!” Jinny moved towards her cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean it—a wife like you would be the making of a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’ll have to walk home!” said Jinny, springing into
her seat. It was too ironic a climax to the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in my slippers!” gasped Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have put on your boots!” said Jinny sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But listen!” He clung to the cart as if he would stop it.
“It’s a heaven-sent opportunity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be sent back,” said Jinny gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean for me,” he explained desperately. “You know
how Polly objects to my marrying again. But I’ve got to break
the deal with Duke to her, so I could work in the two at once. It
couldn’t be worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never marry,” said Jinny. “Gee up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But whoa, whoa, you don’t carry only your husbands,” cried
Tony. “Stop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pursued Methusalem for some yards, but even Methusalem
was too quick for him. And then, as he stood panting and
perspiring and overcome by a dark upwelling of disbelief in life,
he perceived the Duchess with her manuscript and his daughter
returning from the histrionic consultation at “The Learned Pig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank the Lord, Polly’s feeding out,” he murmured, as he
slunk into a doorway. Then his face brightened up. “After
all,” he thought, “I’ve only got to break to her about the
theatre.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> darkest season in Jinny’s life—outwardly a feast of light—was
come to the crowning mockery of its August splendour.
Day after day there was the lazy pomp of high summer; massive
white clouds in a blue sky, a spacious voluptuousness, a languid
glory. But Jinny felt less melancholy on the rare days when
sea-mists rolled in from the marshes and spectral sheep were
heard tinkling from dim meadows. The corn was now cut, and
this too was a curious alleviation of the gnawing at her heart.
When the far-spreading wheat-fields had rustled in the sun like
the hair of the earth-mother, an auburn gold touched with
amber and purple lights, infinitely subtle and suffusive, the
beauty of it all had been almost intolerable. Now that remorseless
reapers had turned the wheat into rows of stooks that were
more suggestive of the hair of a village girl in curl-papers, Jinny
found it easier to jog on her sorely diminished business along the
sunbaked roads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not merely that Will had turned from a swain into an
enemy, and from a figure of romance into a business rival. It
was not merely that his hated handsome visage kept coming up
in her mind at the oddest moments, to the confusion of her
work. It was the pressure of his competition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto Jinny had believed in mankind. Despite “The
Seven Stages of Life,” by which her Spelling-Book combined
instruction in old English print with detailed information on how
the Devil blurs God’s image in man; despite the testifyings of
her fellow-Peculiars to their own wickedness, she had regarded
her fellow-beings as in the main virtuous and kindly. What was
she to think of human nature when she saw this dashing innovator
literally “carrying” all before him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her pique and distress she failed to allow for the sensation
created by the advent of the small second-hand coach with its
pair of high-stepping black horses. Nothing so great and
momentous had happened in Bradmarsh from time immemorial.
Even in Jinny’s own mind it loomed as large as any of the events
in the Spelling-Book, from Noah’s Flood to Trafalgar. Throughout
all those somnolent Essex by-ways the passage of the novel
equipage brought everybody to door or window. It was equal
to the passing of the County Flyer on the main roads, a thunder
of wheels and a jingle of harness and a music of the horn. True,
two horses are not four, and a driver who blows his own trumpet
has not the grandeur of a coachman with a scarlet-coated guard,
not to mention the absence of relays to paw the ground and be
switched without loss of a second to the fiery vehicle. Still, with
scarcely a hill to negotiate before Chipstone, two horses and a
man seemed velocity and magnificence to villages accustomed to
a crawling two-wheeled tilt-cart and a girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Flynt Flyer—as it styled itself in vainglorious paint—had
created a demand, as well as a sensation, even if the want
had been unfelt before. Starting three services a week instead
of two, it moreover dashed and zigzagged into corners and by-roads
that Jinny had never pretended to serve, the denizens of
which had been content to wait at cross-roads and landmarks, or
to deal with her through intermediary neighbours or houses of
call. And besides these attractions of convenience and novelty,
there was the comfort for passengers of riding in the body of
the coach with their feet in the straw, instead of dangling uneasily
from the narrow side-ledges in Jinny’s cart or sprawling in
contorted adjustment to parcels and boxes. Persons who had
always walked, now found it simpler to jump into the coach
than to fag along in the heat. The carrying business saw itself
transformed and extended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this elegant and epoch-making vehicle the non-human
freight overflowing from the fore and hind boots was stacked on
the roof, though the lucky first-comer had always space to sit beside
Will and hear his stories of the great world. A shipmate from
’Frisco had boasted of driving in kid gloves a polished silk-lined cab
and spanking fifteen-hundred-dollar steeds with silver-gleaming
harness, and earning his three hundred dollars a month. The
vision beglamoured Will’s own status on the box, and reconciled
him to lifting the luggage of his labouring inferiors. He aped
it by driving in his best Moses &amp; Son suit, as though more of a
sporting charioteer than a menial, touting for custom. And
parcels and clients flung themselves into his arms. What
wonder if the high-piled load soon out-topped Jinny’s, revealed
in its nakedness on these sweltering days when she drove
without her tilt! For gradually folk’s eyes seemed opened,
unsealed of a spell. Without a word spoken it was as if something
unnatural and monstrous had been wafted away, and the
simple order of nature—in the shape of a male carrier—had been
restored. Without being quite conscious of how they had
lugged their own boxes for the puny female, customers were
aware of a new facility. They did not so much turn against
Jinny as forget her in this gravitation to the natural centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Will had—with a touch of considerateness—fixed his
days on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, not to clash with
Jinny’s Tuesdays and Fridays. But as his supply created new
demands, as he found he could widen his ambit as far even as
Brandy Hole Creek or Blackripple, he took on new circuits, first
for Tuesday and then for Friday and dropping his Wednesdays
to give his hard-worked horses a solid rest in mid-week. It was
not these new routes of his that galled Jinny, nor his impinging
on her days—possibly she was not altogether displeased to meet
the rival vehicle. No, the iron that entered her soul was the
loss of her previous customers, who, despite Will’s comparative
magnanimity, had changed their day to suit the rival round. In
the cases where she had imagined herself a friend rather than an
employee, it was heart-breaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence this new and rankling doubt of her species, waxing daily
as her business waned. Folk seemed to follow one another like
sheep, and whenever now on a bit of miry road she came upon
the serried footmarks of a flock, she shuddered with a sense of
the ignoble pettiness of the pattern: no massive individual
stamp like Methusalem’s, not even a characteristic dent like
Nip’s, but an ignominious churning of mud by a multiplication
of innumerable little identities. Pigs, too, supplied her with
bitter comparisons when, with her cart void of passengers and
almost empty of parcels, she passed at some cross-road the Flynt
Flyer, stiflingly chock-full of both. For she had often noted in
the feeding of swine that however abundant the food at its
snout, master pig will always rush to the thickest jostling-point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the crowd, such was humanity, thought our little
cynic; who was, however, no mere soured philosopher, but a
harassed housekeeper, with a couple of aged dependents, whose
rashers or oats were becoming seriously endangered. Methusalem
had always lived from hoof to mouth, and as for her grandfather,
had he not spent all his savings on her Angel-Mother’s debts? There
were still potatoes in the store, and half a flitch in the larder, and
beer in the barrel, and vegetables in the ground, and milk in
the goats’ udders, but the reserves of provender, as of cash, were
small, and Methusalem, whose appetite age could not abate, now
began to loom as a deficit rather than an asset. Nip was the
first to notice—and with pained astonishment—the parsimony of
the new regime. Why keep a mistress if one is to be practically
thrown back on one’s own resources?</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In these circumstances it scarcely seemed on a par with the
ethics of the Spelling-Book, or of a piece with Jinny’s character,
that she should go to Miss Gentry and order a new Sunday dress
of pink sprigged muslin of the latest design—a gown that
but for its not hooking up at the back was absolutely ladylike.
Still less that she should drive in it on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Whether it was in emulation of her rival, on the theory that
fashionableness was a factor of his success, whether it was to
brighten up her spirits, or to exhibit a defiant prosperity, Jinny
did not reveal, even to herself. But that it was worn at Will
rather than on herself, may be deduced from the fact that the
commission to the “French dressmaker” followed hard upon
her first encounter with the Flynt Flyer at the cross-roads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on this occasion—as at many subsequent meetings on
Tuesdays or Fridays—that Nip was torn almost literally in two
by his desire to be in both vehicles at once. That they should
wish to pass each other without a halt or even a hail was amazing
to the poor animal, and if his distraction usually ended in a leap
on to the coach, where Will was never without a beguiling
biscuit, he was always careful to rejoin the cart before the
interval had become too spacious. Though a Nip-o’-both-sides,
he was disloyal to neither: indeed, if ever creature did his best
to bring two foolish mortals together, that creature was Nip.
But they no longer even saluted each other. At first, indeed,
the gentleman driver had doffed his hat gallantly, but Jinny’s
face had remained a stone, though that stone was a ruby. Will,
therefore, when he had to meet or pass her, flew by at a rate
which by its air of insolent superiority only increased her resentment.
Later, he had begun to slow down when he espied her
lumbering along his route, and to play the “Buy a Broom”
polka on his horn with malicious accuracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By way of retort Jinny once tied a label to Nip’s collar, marked
“In charge of the guard.” It was meant to taunt Will with
lacking the dignity of a true driver, who never blew a horn. But
the somewhat periphrastic sarcasm seemed to miss fire, for Will
took the label literally, and when Nip had executed his usual
leap on to the coach, he kept him prisoner for several days. The
faithful animal, though fed as never before, was as unhappy, tied
on the roof, as Jinny was, and when her cart at last passed, and
her horn blew imperiously for him, he made such a supercanine
effort that his cord snapped, and in an instant he was snuggling
hysterically in the legitimate lap; regardless of that flowery
summery fabric. His label, she found, now bore the words,
“Pay Up The Gloves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas, paying up—whether for wagers or fabrics—was out of
Jinny’s power. That very morning Miss Gentry had handed
her the bill, delicately wrapped in a tract. Such a situation was
quite new to her, though not unprovided against in the Spelling-Book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This had been a large expense, yet she had not weighed it. It
was her debts and not her savings that had in such haste amounted
to pounds. Woe to the pride that had seduced her:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>She did not need her book’s reminder of her head’s weakness—only
too dismally she recognized that strange slipperiness of
memory which made it more difficult to execute her commissions
in proportion as their number dwindled. Was not the little
notebook, to which she must now have recourse, the abiding
symbol of this paradoxical humiliation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was not psychologist enough to understand that it was the
very perfection of her memory which was now tripping her up.
So many of her clients had for so long demanded the same
things so seasonably that she was automatically compelled to
carry out commissions that had now lapsed. She was like an
actress who knows her part even backwards, but is broken up
and confused when cuts are made; finding the too familiar words
not to be ousted. Jinny would mechanically purchase items for
clients who had forsaken her, and then—so scatterbrained was
she become—leave them at other customers’ houses! And on
the other hand, she was capable of forgetting the orders of the
few faithful. It was thus that under the combined strain of
Miss Gentry’s bill, the sultry August weather, the sight of the
packed coach and its jaunty driver, the frantic return of Nip
with his mocking message, Jinny, whom necessity had compelled
to keep Farmer Gale as a customer, clean forgot his urgent need
of a wedding-cake. It was not that she had forgotten to order
it or even to fetch it from the leading confectioner’s. The
sudden union of Farmer Gale with the wealthy land-surveyor’s
widow, whose piano-playing had excited the far-off admiration
of Elijah Skindle, was too sensational an event, especially to
herself, to permit of complete oblivion. It was only that she
forgot to deliver the cake at Beacon Chimneys. She was actually
within sight of the stag-headed poplars that marked the horizon
of home, when, turning her head as Nip suddenly leapt for a
rabbit, she saw the great elegant carton in the cart. And the
wedding was on the morrow. Conscience-stricken, and morbidly
feeling as though the marriage would scarcely be legal without
this colossal confection, she resolved, worn out as she was with
the heat, to drive back to the house. But she had reckoned
without Methusalem. To turn back within the very smell of
his stable was unprecedented: it violated every equine code.
Like Nip, he now became aware of the instability of things—of a
new order. But, more obstinate, he refused to recognize it.
Nothing short of the whip—which would have moved him, not
out of pain but out of astonishment—could have sufficed to
turn him, and how could a mistress who knew him in the right
and herself in the wrong, resort to that, especially after such a
sultry day? So after every effort to coax him or to lead him by
the bridle had failed and almost twenty minutes had been wasted,
she decided—in view of her grandfather’s supper—to make a
special journey the first thing in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she gave Methusalem his glad head, she remembered that
it was just before the turning to the hymeneal homestead that
she had met that scandalously successful coach.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Before Jinny reached home that evening, a complainant had
already called at Blackwater Hall to unload his grievance. Such
visitors were, alas, no longer a novelty to Daniel Quarles, who
had one day begun to find himself no merely nominal representative
of the business, but a principal charged with derelictions.
His virulent rebuttals of the reproaches did but increase the
defections. The flouted customers made no allowances for the
ferocities of senility, and, when told to go to hell, simply went
to the Flynt Flyer—a much pleasanter alternative. Indeed,
one suspects they welcomed the insult as justifying gravitation
to the new star. The indelicacy, however, of divulging
its existence to the nonagenarian was reserved for Mr. Elijah
Skindle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That rising practitioner’s patronage was not the least of
Jinny’s humiliations. Even after his proposal of marriage, she
had not been able to refuse to carry dogs to and from his establishment
when so commanded by her clients, though she had drawn
the line at orders originating from himself. Now, however, in
justice to her grandfather, she could not but accept his commissions,
even though she was aware they were largely artificial,
mere canals for communication and courtship. Why, for
example, could not Mr. Skindle, whose gig was often at gardens
buzzing with beehives, not purchase his own honey? Why
must she procure him an article linkable with “moons” and
permitting fatuous references to “sweetness”? His protestations
of lack of time were too brazen even for his own mouth: he
stuttered and blushed like a schoolboy. It will be seen that
Elijah’s deeper self had not accepted his “lucky” escape from
her. Hope springs eternal, especially when the desirable one’s
pride is bent, if not broken, by adversity. That proud stomach
which had rejected his proffered luxuries with disdain now bade
fair to be empty. While he, moreover, touched nothing he did
not profit by, and through a lucky rise in animal sickness was
fast overtaking the respectable Jorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an audacity almost Napoleonic he had conceived the
idea of at once blazoning and curing his baldness, purchasing a
hair-restorer through Jinny herself, so that she might be an
accessory to the improvement at which he was—obviously for
her sake—slaving. And there did actually begin to sprout on
his cranium microscopic dots, like pepper sprinkled over an egg-shell.
Elijah lost no opportunity now of lifting his cap at the
sight of her, though he had not yet acquired the habit of removing
it indoors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoa!” Elijah drew up his trap in the grassy lane before
Blackwater Hall and jumped down. The afterglow of sunset
was in the sky, but the Common was still torpid with the breezeless
heat of the day. He was in his best flannel suit and smartest
cap, though the same old pipe stuck in his blackened teeth.
Removing it, he rapped at the door with it, knocking out the
ashes with the same taps. As nothing happened, he tugged
from his pocket a paper-wrapped pot and thudded at the door
with that. He had been simulating rage, for he had come to
denounce a mistake, though enchanted to have the opportunity
of calling on Jinny. But now for fear she was not yet back—and
vexed with himself for not choosing one of her domestic
days—he began to get really ruffled. He lifted the latch unceremoniously,
but the door seemed bolted. Re-pocketing the pot
with an unsmothered oath, he moved towards the living-room
wall and peeped through the wide-flung little casement. Pah!
Only the Gaffer snoring in his favourite posture, head on the
family Bible. The shabbiness of the ancient earth-coloured smock-frock,
like the meanness of the furniture, added to Elijah’s disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy her slaving in this heat,” he mused, “when she might
be snoozing on my horsehair sofa!” He shouted angrily,
“Wake up, you old codger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nonagenarian obeyed with a start. “What’s amiss, my
little mavis?” he yawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t a mavis,” Elijah informed him irately, “I’m a
veterinary surgeon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel Quarles sprang to his feet. “Marciful powers! Anything
wrong with Methusalem?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—” Elijah assured him through the little window,
“I’ve come about Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man tottered and caught at his chair. “An accident
to Jinny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stuff and nonsense! She’ll be home any minute. Can I
come in and wait for her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel growled and grumbled. “Don’t you see Oi’m busy
readin’ the Scriptures?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t interfere with that.” He moved back to the door
and rattled the latch masterfully. He suddenly saw the possibility
of pushing his suit with the grandfather. “Why do you
lock yourself in?” he demanded, as the bolts creaked back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you see they’ve took the Dutch clock?” said the
Gaffer pitifully. “She desarts me all day long, and Oi can’t
have my eyes everywheres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah glanced up at the clock in the ante-room, ticking as
imperturbably as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s up there!” he said, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do ye don’t try to befool me. That’s the same face, but
they’ve took out the works and put in rubbidge. But it ain’t
works we’re justified by,” he added musingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah, picking his way among the old cypress chests, followed
him into the living-room, sat down unasked on the settle, and
mechanically pulled out his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Git out o’ my house!” roared Daniel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah’s pipe fell on the rush mat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boldero hisself,” explained the ancient, “never durst smoke
in my nostrils. And who be you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who was Boldero, Elijah thought a more sensible question.
But he picked up his pipe with an apology. “All right,
uncle, no harm done.” He wiped his forehead. “Warm, ain’t
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do ye want hell-smoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t quite call this hell-smoke,” Elijah deprecated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no smoke without hell-fire,” Daniel explained.
“Farmer Thoroughgood, he smoked just such a pipe as yourn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he was thorough good, you see,” said Elijah with an
air of victorious repartee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thorough bad,” chuckled the Gaffer with a still greater air
of wit. “Starved his missus to death. The neighbours as
come, to see the corpse found her on a bed made out of a common
sheep-hurdle, stood on bricks.” He tapped the Bible with a
dirty thumb. “Do ye don’t yoke a hoss and ass together, says
the Book. But that evil-doer used to plough a field with a cow
and a donkey, and when it ploughed too hard, he’d harness an
old sow in front of the donkey—there’s currant-trees there now
what pays better, not needin’ no ploughin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite like the old song,” observed Elijah, still feeling superior
and witty. “<span class='it'>There was a cow went out to plough.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Chrissimus Day, Chrissimus Day</span>,” hummed the old man.
Set agoing, he quavered on:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Set ye down,” he broke off genially, though Elijah was already
ensconced, leg over knee. “Jinny’ll be home in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder she’s so long,” Elijah began tentatively, “when
she’s got so little to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay,” assented the ancient, souring again. “ ’Tis me that’s
got the whole work o’ the place. But gals likes to gad about in
the summer, what becomes o’ the old folks never troubles the
young ’uns nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They might just as well be married,” ventured Elijah boldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, their husbands ’ud make ’em work,” said the Gaffer, his
eye gleaming maliciously. “But Oi don’t howd with starvin’
’em, like Farmer Thoroughgood did his missus. When they
come to see her corpse they found her on a bed made out of
a common sheep-hurdle. Ay, and he used to plough his fields
with a——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah, groaning inwardly, composed himself to hear the story
again. Fortunately there was a fresh development at the
finish. “One day ’twas a team o’ bullocks and a blind hoss he
started droivin’. Powerful warrum it war—wuss than to-day—and
the flies sow worritin’ that the bullocks set their tails up
and bolted. The poor blind hoss couldn’t see where to goo and
fell down. The oxen couldn’t drag him, and got tangled up in
the traces.” He roared with laughter at the picture, and Elijah
grinned too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those flies do worrit,” he agreed, flicking at his forehead.
“But about that Jinny of yours——” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll onny have them harmless fly-papers, you see,” said
Daniel, pointing to a coloured patch on the ceiling, blackened by
a happy multitude. “Ef ye can’t wait for her,” he added
amiably, “Oi’ll give her your message. A wet you said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A veterinary surgeon, Mr. Elijah Skindle,” said Elijah
grandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Skindle!” The old man groped agitatedly in his memory.
“That’s a name Oi know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Known all over the Hundred,” said Elijah complacently.
“Ay, and they’re hearing of my success at Colchester, too, where
I come from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cowchester!” The old man sprang up. “That’s it—the
man as married Annie! But that ain’t you—he had more hair
to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it was my father,” said Elijah, flushing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay. Annie couldn’t have a son your soize,” the
Gaffer pondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother’s name <span class='it'>is</span> Annie,” said Elijah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange fire crept into the old patriarch’s eyes. “A big-boned
mawther of a girl, tall as the rod her father lit the lamps
with, long raven hair and eyes as black as sloes, and a wunnerful
fine buzzom,” he said with slow voluptuousness. “Your mother
ain’t like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” admitted Elijah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel Quarles heaved a sigh. “Oi thought not, or you’d be
more of a beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re wrong,” retorted Elijah. “For I’ve heard that
my grandfather did use to light the lamps in Chipstone, and it’s
a great shame the way my brothers and sisters all dump her on
me to keep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man seized him suddenly by the coat-lapels. “She’s
back in Chipstone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Been back over two years—ever since father died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s dead?” Elijah felt the hands trembling against his
breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—and I’ve got her to keep, though I’m the
youngest,” he grumbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the same luck as Oi had,” said the Gaffer, “with this
bit of property, though Sidrach, he’s the first-born.” He dropped
pensively back into his chair. “But Oi count Annie’s better off
where she is, bein’ as Oi’ve got Jinny to keep and food gittin’
dearer every day, she says, something cruel. And happen
Sidrach’ll come back too when he’s old, not havin’ landed property
like me, ne yet no relations in Babylon. Never been sech a year
since he went away—the Brad was all froze over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah imprudently recollected—to the old man’s annoyance—that
it had frozen equally in Queen Victoria’s first winter, and
he brought up “Murphy’s coldest day,” the proverbial lucky hit
of an almanack-maker. Fortunately the Gaffer recalled an
ancient jest of Bundock’s: “Mother Gander’s gin-bottle’s froze
over,” and relaxed in genial hysterics. “Ay, she’s conwerted
now,” he said, wiping his rheumy eyes. “But what an adulteress
in them days! Ye couldn’t get drunk at ‘The Black Sheep’ ef
ye tried—beer without hops and wine without gripes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mechanically drawing out his pipe and popping it back in
alarm, Elijah reverted to Jinny. Daniel now blamed Methusalem
for her lateness. Horses, too, were lazy and ungrateful,
same as granddaughters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you get rid of him?” said Elijah, with a sudden
inspiration. That would cut her comb, he thought. Jinny
docked of Methusalem would be ripe for the marriage-altar.
“He’s long past his work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Daniel Quarles shook his head. “Jinny wouldn’t like me
to part with that. Besides, who’d buy him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would,” said Elijah, with a feeling of “All for love, or the
world well lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You? Od rabbet, what for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d give you a fiver!” parried the knacker in his reckless
passion. “Though most people let me have ’em for the trouble
of killing ’em,” he added incautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man sprang up again. “Git out o’ my house! And
don’t ye dare cross my doorstep agen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah cowered back in his seat. “But I’ve come on business,”
he protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi bain’t a-gooin’ to sell Methusalem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not what I came for,” Elijah urged soothingly. “It’s
about Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi bain’t a-gooin’ to sell Jinny neither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah winced. Was it divination or drivel, he wondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might as well sell her,” he said boldly. “Look how
she’s mucking up your business, muddling everything.” And
rising and pulling out the pot again, he banged it down on the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Jinny muddle things! Git out o’ my house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the Gaffer’s blazing spectacles and furious fangs Elijah
backed doorwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not before it’s set right,” he said, assured of his line of
retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Quarleses don’t make muddles. For a hundred year——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny’s been all right the last hundred years,” he interrupted
impatiently. “It’s the last few weeks I complain about!
I hope it’s not sunstroke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Jinny!” The Gaffer’s anger died. “She went away
singin’ as merry as could be, my little mavis,” he said
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what do you make of that?” Elijah indicated the pot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man unwrapped it slowly, and readjusting his spectacles
spelt out the label. “Oliver’s Depil—Depil—” he stumbled on.
“Is that pills?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s for the hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s what you want, ain’t it?” he said naïvely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Skindle coloured up. “But this is to take off the hair,”
he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can’t do that,” chuckled Daniel, “bein’ more a
’Lisha than a ’Lijah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, I can,” said Elijah, his every dot bristling. “But if
I hadn’t been a noticing man, I should have undone all the good
of months of my pots of hair-restorer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whichever way it be, ’tis agen Nature,” said the Gaffer.
“The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. But pots be as
like as peas. That’s the shopman’s fault, not Jinny’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, indeed!” cried Elijah savagely. “And what about her
bringing me hairpins?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hairpins!” gasped the Gaffer. “Hairpins for a man
without hair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even Samson in his prime didn’t want hairpins!” Elijah
pointed out angrily. “But that’s what she brought me a packet
of last week, instead of tobacco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sarve ye right, ye unswept chimbley,” the Gaffer growled,
with a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t serving me right,” riposted Elijah. “That’s
serving me wrong,” he added with redoubled wit. “And
wouldn’t take ’em back neither, the little minx, maintained I’d
ordered ’em for my ma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>she’d</span> want hairpins, wouldn’t she, with all that beautiful
raven hair,” said the Gaffer, turning serious. “Happen you
ordered ’em for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never order anything for her,” said Elijah, waiving the
description of her chevelure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More shame to you, then, young man. Ye don’t desarve to
have her. Same as ye’re too stingy to pay for the hairpins, ye’d
best give ’em to her with Daniel Quarles’s love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not stingy!” retorted Elijah hotly. “Would I be
keeping my mother, with the poorhouse so handy, and me the
youngest, too, if Elijah Skindle wasn’t the most generous man
in Chipstone? But I won’t pay for Jinny’s woolgathering.
No wonder everybody’s going to the coach!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The coach?” repeated Daniel Quarles. “What coach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t Jinny told you?” cried Elijah, equally astonished.
“The handsomest pair of black horses——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A funeral coach?” half-whispered the Gaffer, paling. The
notion of slaughtering Methusalem had already brought the
thought of death unpleasantly near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and Jinny may well call it so, old sluggaby,” said Elijah
grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man fell back into his chair. “Nobody never needed
no funeral coaches here!” he quavered. “Our shoulders on
the corpse-path was good enough for us. ’Twas onny that
obstinacious little Dap, when poor Pegs laid by the wall, as
wanted one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s talking of funeral coaches?” snapped Mr. Skindle.
“Anyhow I’ve got to have that pot changed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Git out o’ my house!” repeated the ancient for the fourth
time, hurling the pot out of the window. Luckily it fell on grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elijah’s patience was at an end. Besides it had now occurred
to him he might cut off Jinny on the route, away from this
tiresome nonagenarian. The effort to woo her through him had
been baffled by his inconsequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s hankering after your wooden chairs? I’ve got
horsehair at home,” he retorted crushingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he climbed into his trap he heard the bolts shot behind
him. But just as he was clucking off his horse, the Gaffer’s head
popped frenziedly through the casement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop thief!” it cried. “Stop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You be careful what you’re saying, old cockalorum,” said
Elijah angrily, lashing his horse with vicarious wrath. “And
pick up that pot. I shan’t pay for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve stole my spectacles! Oi can’t find ’em nowheres!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you’ve got ’em on!” Elijah called back contemptuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So eagerly did his horse respond to the whip and the homeward
impulse that Elijah had the satisfaction of passing the equally
enthusiastic Methusalem before he could pull up. He was not
even sure that this arrogantly gowned Jinny had acknowledged
his salute. She would be at her door before he could turn—confound
it! Why had he not waited another moment or
started earlier and cut her off at a remoter point? To face that
old dodderer again would be an anti-climax.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>So swiftly did Daniel Quarles nod again over his big Bible that
by the time Jinny had got Methusalem stabled, she could not
rouse him to undo the bolts, and all her merry whistling as she
neared the latch was a wasted pretence. This protective habit of
his indoors was a recent development, coinciding curiously with
the advent of the coach she was concealing from him, and these
closed doors—even his bedroom was now locked from within—annoyed
and alarmed her. She had visions of him agonizing in
his bed and herself reduced to breaking open the door. Perhaps
even now he was ill, dying, dead! She dashed to the living-room
window—stumbling over a pot outside it. Ah, thank God, that
dear, peaceful grey head, that sonorous snore!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pausing now to pick up the mysterious pot, she was distressed
again. The passing of Elijah was explained! Miss Gentry’s
Depilatory she had brought to Mr. Skindle, Mr. Skindle’s Hair
Restorer to Miss Gentry. He had come to complain, but unable
to get admission, he had flung the pot on the path. Oh, plaguy
similarity of potted pomades—fatal double error—she had killed
two clients with one stone. Her eyes filled with tears: even
with a notebook she could not keep straight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So guilty did she look as she scrambled noiselessly through the
casement, that an observer would have thought her a burglar.
Creeping past her grandfather, she opened the house-door,—the
gigantic key that used to hang on the beam was now always in
the lock—brought in the carton with the wedding-cake from the
cart, and placed it on the chest of drawers for unfailing reminder
in the morning. Then swiftly changing into her old frock and
hanging up the new behind a corner-curtain, she donned her
apron and stole into the kitchen. Finally, to lay the table, she
must with loving hands uplift the venerable head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ancient had not slept off his perturbation, though he did
not remember the cause of it, and seeing his supper still unlaid,
he was righteously wroth. “A muddler, mucking up everything—that’s
what you be!” he said, repeating unconsciously Elijah’s
indictment. And Jinny, remembering the pot that now stood
by the wedding-cake, went about wanly, unresentfully, with
movements lacking their wonted deftness. Her grandfather had
already forgotten the suggestion of sunstroke, much as it had
shaken him: for her actual pallor he had no eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she finally brought in the meal, she found him risen
and standing tranced before the great wedding-cake, gazing
dazedly at its elaborately frosted architecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t want to open it,” she cried with irrepressible
petulance as she hooked down the pasteboard lid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ignored the reproach. “Weddin’s and funerals in one
day,” he brooded. “Pomps and wanities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to the table, Gran’fer,” she said more gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pomps and wanities!” he repeated. “Who’s this for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s for Farmer Gale’s wedding—’twas too late to deliver it.
Come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In my day folks made their own weddin’-cakes. And dedn’t
want no funeral coaches neither. The church-path or the farm-wagon——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along!” She took his arm. “There’s no funeral
coaches here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A whining and scratching at the door made a welcome diversion.
Nip, back from the hunting-path, sneaked in, aware of
sin, with ears flat, tail abased, and sidelong squint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t seen that for days,” said the Gaffer. “Where’s that
been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” she lied, glad of Nip’s guilty air, for to explain
would reveal the coach. “On the razzle-dazzle, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper, she remembered a box must be put in the ante-room
that had been left with her to be called for. It was stupid
not to have brought it in at once, ere the cart had been put in
its shed—as stupid as her pot-swapping. In a sudden fear that
if unremoved to-night she would carry it off to Farmer Gale’s
wedding just when the owner would be coming for it, she asked
her grandfather to lend a hand with it. It was an unfortunate
request, for as the still sinewy veteran was dragging his end
over the sill, he said weirdly: “There ain’t no man in Bradmarsh
more lugsome’n that. Who wants your new-fangled coach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What coach?” murmured Jinny, half puzzled, half apprehensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The funeral coach.” He stood still. “Where else ’ould a
coffin goo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish, Gran’fer. There’s no funeral coach.” Her little
silvery voice rang out. “<span class='it'>Heave away, my Johnny.</span> Come along,
Gran’fer, I’ve got to rub down Methusalem—you’ll be too
tired now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No funeral coach?” he repeated slowly, loosing the box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been dreaming, Gran’fer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the two black horses——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her heart beat like a criminal’s on the eve of detection.
“Nightmares!” she laughed. “What did I say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he said——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annie’s buoy-oy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annie’s——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lijah, he calls hisself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elijah? And did he go up in a chariot of fire with the
horses?” And more than ever incensed against Mr. Skindle,
she hastily started her carrier’s chanty:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inwardly she was thinking that a “funeral coach” was just
what it was. Did its bells not ring the knell of all the peaceful
past? Yes, it was the hearse of her past, of her youth. And
somehow—somehow—she must readjust herself to the strange
raw cruelty of the present.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>She resettled him before his Bible. But when she returned
from the stable, he had wandered again to the chest of drawers,
and was now holding up the pot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And ye told me Oi was dreamin’!” he said angrily. “Why
did ye lie to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Gran’fer?” she said, flushing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did that pot come here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I brought it, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you dedn’t. Annie’s good-for-nawthen son brought it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I brought it in,” she persisted. “It was lying on the
path.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Oi mind me now—he threw it at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wretch!” said Jinny, believing him. “Poor Gran’fer!”
she cried with self-reproach, patting his hairy hand. “But it’s
bedtime. Come along!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did ye lie to me?” he repeated, unappeased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no funeral coach,” she persisted. But even as she
spoke, the faint tooting of a horn was heard from afar. Nip, idly
gulping at flies, pricked up his ears; the ancient uttered a cry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The coach! The coach!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s hand clutched his more tightly. They could now hear
the distant rattling and jingling—the Flynt Flyer was incredibly
coming their way, along that grass-grown road. What was it
doing by that lonely Common, she wondered tremulously. What
customers were there to steal here? Did the pirate hanker even
after Uncle Lilliwhyte?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll lose your beauty sleep, Gran’fer!” She drew him
towards the corkscrew staircase. But he broke from her convulsively
and hobbled out into the path, and stood with hand at
ear towards the advancing clatter. To be seen staring at its
meteoric passing would be too dreadful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go in, Nip,” she cried with unwonted harshness. “Are you
coming, Gran’fer?” she said, following the dog, “or shall I bolt
you out? Must bolt up against thieves, you know.” And she
began singing cheerily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, ’tis the black hosses that bears the bells away, curse
’em. What should coaches be doing in these parts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same as me, I suppose,” she said with desperate lightness.
“It’s only that young man who fancies himself a-driving and
a-blowing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A young man come to steal <span class='it'>my</span> business!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, one can’t lock that up! Come in, Gran’fer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll lock <span class='it'>him</span> up! What’s the thief’s name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not a thief. It’s the young man from Frog Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That whippersnapper! Come with a coach to drive over
you and me——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what he’d try to do if we stand here! Come
inside—the jackanips’ll only think we’re envying his bonkka
turn-out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The argument and the touch of idiom succeeded, though she
could feel his form shaking with passion as she drew him in.
“Why did ye keep it from me?” he asked pitifully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I knew you’d get in a state.” As she shot the bolts,
the better to shut Will out, she realized that her beating heart
was somehow left outside, and that it was drawing her after it
through doors howsoever barred and windows howsoever fastened,
if only to watch the pageant of his passing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A funeral coach,” the ancient was mumbling, “you and
Jinny may well call it so, ole sluggaby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, we may, Gran’fer,” she said, smiling. “For it’s
his own funeral he’s conducting. He’ll soon come a cropper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blast him!” growled the Gaffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” Jinny was shocked. “It’s all as fair as fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For over a hundred year we’ve fetched and carried ’twixt
Bradmarsh and Chipstone, and now this scallywag with his new-fangled
black hosses——” A fit of coughing broke off the speech,
and he suddenly looked so much like the last stage of man in the
Spelling-Book that Jinny had to put him back into his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I say you’d get into a state? But you know there’s
more carrying than I—than we can manage. Haven’t you sent
lots of our customers away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse ’em!” said the Gaffer comprehensively. “Warmin!
And Oi told ’em sow to their head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s only got our leavings, you see.” And she burst out in
gay parody:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'><span class='it'>’Tis Methusalem bears the bells away.</span>”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But the bells were now jingling nearer and nearer—jingling in
victorious arrogance. The old man started up again in his chair.
“How dare Caleb Flynt’s lad set hisself up agen me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, Gran’fer.” She pressed him down. “Competition,
folks call it. He’s got to earn his living just like us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody shan’t come competitioning here.” He broke from
her again. “Daniel shall be an adder what biteth the hoss
heels.” He began unbolting the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never be able to bite <span class='it'>his</span> horse heels,” she urged.
“They fly by like the wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a sick fear the old man would hurl himself at the
bridles, be dragged to death. But to her astonishment, ere he
had lifted the latch, she heard the horses slowing down. The
eight sounding hoofs, the clanging swingle-trees and harness, the
great road-grinding equipage, were actually coming to a halt at
her porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoa, Snowdrop! Easy there, Cherry-blossom!” She
knew the humour of these names of theirs, as she knew from a
hundred channels of gossip everything about their owner, even
to the identity of the blonde young female from Foxearth Farm
who was so persistently a passenger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he had been forced to humiliate himself, to make the first
approach—it was she who had, after all, been the conqueror, who
had held out the longer! And in a swift flood of emotion she
felt more than ever the injustice of her grandfather’s standpoint.
Will had not “come competitioning.” It had all been unpremeditated.
The horses had been left on his hands by that
harum-scarum Showman. And anyhow, was he not serving the
countryside better than she with her ramshackle little cart?
But whatever the rights and the wrongs, a scene between the
two men must be prevented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s come to eat humble pie, Gran’fer,” she whispered.
“But we don’t see people after office hours—and it’s your
bedtime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll show him who’s who,” said the Gaffer, disregarding her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can’t do that like this!” she urged with the cunning
of desperation. “Put on your Sunday smock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay! Oi’ll larn him to come crakin’ and vauntin’.”
His face lit up with baleful satisfaction, as he thought of the
rare stitching in the gathers and patterns of that frock of fine
linen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Jinny, relieved, was sheep-dogging him up to his room, they
heard the butt-end of a whip beating at the house-door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daniel Quarles takes his time, young man,” the Gaffer
observed to the cobwebbed corkscrew staircase. And to Jinny,
when she shut his door on him, he called back: “Do ye don’t
forgit to put out the beer. And two glasses.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>That imperious butt-end gave no time to change back to her
own ostentatious costume. But she did not pause even to tear
off her flecked apron. After all, in face of his surrender, she
could forgo arrogance of appearance. Besides, he would scarcely
have time to notice anything, so swiftly must she be rid of him—however
she might savour his surrender—before her grandfather
could re-descend upon him. True, the call for beer showed a
relaxed tension, but who could predict the effect of quaffing it
upon two hot-tempered males? Ignoring the injunction, she
hurried to the house-door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, Miss Boldero.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a shade disconcerted by the formality. But a great
waft of the old friendship seemed to emanate from his frank eyes
and the red hair his hat-lifting uncovered. She felt herself
drawn to that flame like a poor little moth: she wanted to fall
upon his magnanimous morning-jacket, to sob away her sin of
pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, Mr. Flynt,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was astonished at the sight of her, and taken aback.
Mentally he had shaken her off, had ridden over her by force of
will, finding occupation and exhilaration in his new and prosperous
adventure; finding consolation, too, in the creamy
beauty of the girl who shuttled with such suspicious frequency
in the Flynt Flyer. Blanche suggested not only cream but
butter, so pliant and pattable did she seem, so ready to take the
impress of Will’s personality. That was very restful after the
intense irritativeness of the rival carrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For irritativeness still remained to him Jinny’s essence—even
in their alienation. Her horn-blowing still jarred, her pink
muslin dress was a new provocation. He was vexed at her
jog-trot apathy when their vehicles passed, an apathy that took
the sting out of his speed. He was piqued that she did not
complain to any one of his competition, that she took no steps
of reprisal, made no objection even to Nip’s visits to him. But
the central irritation in all these fleeting glimpses and encounters
had been her prettiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, seeing her close for the first time since their quarrel at
the cattle-market, and without her being whisked away, he had a
shock. Why, she was not pretty at all: she was shabby and
wan! Where was the sparkle that had haunted the depths of
him? The real Jinny was, it suddenly became patent, a worn
creature with shadows under her eyes and little lines on her
forehead. How could he ever have imagined her attractive?
Why, Blanche was like a sultana beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the thrill he had expected to feel was replaced by this
dull disappointment, another emotion did not fail to supervene.
It was pity—pity not unmixed with compunction. Had it been
so manly as he had thought, to come interfering with her business,
violating the immemorial local tradition which assigned the
carrying to a Quarles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you come in?” she was forced to say, seeing him
silent and petrified in the porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you—I’ve only brought this from Miss Gentry,” he
answered in awkward negation. He had come to jeer, but now
he held the pot of Hair Restorer apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny went from white to red. It was the supreme humiliation.
Not only had he not come to make it up: he had come
at the culminating moment of his triumph—sent as a carrier to
<span class='it'>her</span>! And sent not merely with a parcel, but with the proof of
her blundering!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How kind of her!” she said, taking it, but neither her hand
nor her voice was steady. “Did she send any message with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not particularly.” He had meant to rub in Miss Gentry’s
denunciations of female stupidity, to demand the other pot, but
his heart failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, thank her for her present,” said poor Jinny, struggling
hard for composure. “And tell her I’ll be giving her something
in return on my next round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suppressed a smile; shamed from it by the pathos of her
courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess she means it for your grandfather,” he said chivalrously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps she does,” Jinny murmured. She turned away to
close the door on herself. The beautiful black horses pawed the
ground impatiently. Will shuffled and squirmed less gracefully—there
seemed nothing to do but to go. Had he not refused to
step inside? But he had taken her at the end of his long round,
he had deposited all his passengers and packages, and he felt
loth to leave her thus. A resolution was forming within him—generating
so rapidly in the warmth of compunction and renewed
comradeship, that possibly the germs of it had already taken
root in his subconsciousness when Nip’s label brought him her
sneer at his lack of a guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very hot,” he fenced, lingering. “Can I have a glass
of water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started, remembering the Gaffer’s admonition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, won’t you have a glass of beer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks, just Adam’s ale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost liquefied herself by feeling this son of Adam needed
her,—even thus slightly—she moved swiftly to and fro, returning
with the glass. But not so swiftly that she had not smuggled
Oliver’s Depilatory and the wedding-cake into the kitchen in
case he should yet come in. He took the glass, managing to
touch her cold trembling fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much obliged,” he said, after a deep draught, and this time
it was <span class='it'>her</span> fingers that were drawn, though less consciously, to
touch his round the returned glass. Then, swallowing something
harder than water, “I’ve been thinking about it all, Jinny,
and I’m sorry——” he blurted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” Her heart leapt up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry for you,” he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For me?” Her face hardened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—mean,” he corrected, stammeringly, “sorry to hurt
your business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t hurt my business! There’s room for both!
It’s a fair competition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very forgiving of you to say so. But I said I’d start a
coach-service and I had to make my word good, hadn’t I? A
man can’t say a thing and leave it empty air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” In her new humility she was prepared to admire
such solid manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s no reason why we should be bad friends, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had thought that it was; now, that attitude of hers
seemed childishly foolish. Self-abasement kept her dumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No reason,” he repeated, mistaking her silence for obstinacy,
“why we shouldn’t shake hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only this glass,” she flashed more happily. But it shook in
her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” He sighed with satisfaction. The way to his proposition
lay open. He could broach it at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much better to pull together, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much,” she echoed. How sweet to see the mists of folly and
bitterness rolling away, to feel the weight lifting from her heart.
Impulsively she held out her left hand, and as he clasped it, the
warmth that came to him from its cold firmness somewhat shook
his sense of Blanche’s surpassing charm. Charm, in fact, seemed—to
his bewilderment—to be independent of beauty. Or was it
that what radiated from Jinny’s little hand was a sense of
capable comradeship, missing from that large limp palm which
received but did not give? Well, but comradeship was what he
wanted, what he was now going to propose. And if charm was
thrown in, so much the better for the partnership.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha, Son of Belial! So ye’ve come to bog and vaunt your
horn here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was her forgotten grandfather. Startled from her daydream,
she dropped the glass and it shivered to fragments. In
the dusk Daniel Quarles, wizened though he was, loomed prophetic
over them in snowy beard and smock, his forehead gloomed
with thunder and his ancient beaver.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Will drew out his white handkerchief, and tying it on his whip
waved it humorously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man was disconcerted in his Biblical vein. “This be
a rummy ’un, Jinny. Is he off his head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Gran’fer—that’s a flag of truce. A signal he’s got
something friendly to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gaffer turned on her. “Then why don’t ye arx him inside
like a Christian, ’stead o’ breakin’ my glasses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Quarles,” said Will swiftly. He lowered the
flag, and almost rushed across the threshold. Jinny retreated
before him, and the trio passed silently through the ticking ante-chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t ye loight the lamp?” the Gaffer grumbled.
Jinny gratefully flew to hide her perturbation in the kitchen.
True, she would only be throwing more light upon it. But the
breathing-space was welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t you better have a look at my coach before it gets
darker?” Will was reminded to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse your coach!” He had reawakened the prophet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easy, there!” said Will, untying his handkerchief. “It’s
to be a family coach now, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Family coach!” repeated Daniel, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny, fumbling at the lamp with butter-fingers, was glad it
had not yet illumined her blushes. For, mingled with the
rapturous tumult at her heart was a shrinking sense of impending
publicity, of ethereal emotions too swiftly and masterfully
translated into gross commitments. How had her mere passive
acquiescence in a better relationship warranted Will’s larger
assumptions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s what it’ll be if you accept my proposition, won’t
it?” she heard Will say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set ye down, set ye down!” said Daniel. “What’s your
proposition? Jinny, why’re you lazying with that lamp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a moment, Gran’fer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brought it in, its fat globe shedding a rosy glow over the
dingy wall-paper, the squat chairs, and the china shepherdesses.
But for herself she had no need of it. Everything seemed to her
transfigured, steeped in a heavenly light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s that beer?” the ancient roared, its absence illumined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was glad to escape into the kitchen with her jug. Will
moved towards the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come and see the coach, Mr. Quarles,” he persisted,
“before it’s too dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dang your coach!” But the imprecation was mild and the
ancient shuffled to the door and surveyed the imposing equipage
complete from box to boot, with its glossy sable steeds. Will,
swelling with renewed pride, and mentally comparing it with the
canvas-rotted, lumbering little carrier’s cart and the aged animal
on its last legs, awaited with complacency the rapturous exclamations
of the old connoisseur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they did not come. “Ay, quite soizable, not such a bad
coach, rayther top-heavy. Where’s the leaders?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t want more than two horses on these roads. Ain’t
there plenty o’ pair-horse coaches? Besides it don’t set up for
a coach exactly. I’m a carrier mainly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man winced at the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve called her the Flynt Flyer,” he said, peering at the
painted legend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And fly she does!” said Will, recovering his complacency.
“There’s life and spirit for you!” he added, as the horses pawed
and tossed their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More like an adder biting their heels!” said Daniel balefully.
“But Oi thought Oi heerd they was black!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was outraged. “The Devil himself couldn’t be blacker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel shook his head. “Mud-colour Oi should call the offside
hoss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s black mud, ain’t there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearside hoss seems wheezy,” Daniel said sympathetically,
as it snorted with impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wheezy? Cherry-blossom? Why, he could run ten miles
more without turning a hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he’s sweatin’ like one o’clock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I.” Will wiped his forehead furiously. “But that’s
only the weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hosses don’t want to sweat when there’s nowt to carry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Will was knocked breathless. Recovering, he
smiled complacently. “Why, it’s all delivered. And it <span class='it'>was</span> a
deliverance. A terrible load. Phew!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing to ours! Lord, what a mort o’ custom! Look at
that whopping box we’ve just carried in.” He pointed to the
ante-room. “And all they other boxes!” he added with an
inspiration, staring at the lumber of his deceased and scattered
family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know,” Will conceded graciously, “that there are folks
that stick to Jinny—I mean to you—for old sake’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, and you’re hankerin’ arter our hundred years’ connexion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” said Will, dazed. He stole a reassuring glance at his
magnificent turn-out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi could see what ye were droivin’ at with your friendly
proposition. Want us to take you into pardnership.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will slapped his knee. “Well, I’m danged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel chuckled fatuously. “Ho, ho! Guessed it, did Oi?
Ye can’t keep much from Daniel Quarles.” And in high good
humour he laid his hand on the young man’s shoulder and moved
him back into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found Jinny, who had just deposited the beer-jug on the
table, flitting up the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where ye gooin’, Jinny?” the Gaffer called after her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got things to talk over,” she called back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t secrets,” he crowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t run away,” Will added. “You’re the person most
concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his blushing rival had disappeared. It was all too unnerving,
especially when the cracked mirror, aided by the fat
lamp, showed her what a shabby unkempt figure was setting out
the beer-glasses on the tiger-painted tray. As she could not
change into her grand gown under the invader’s eye, she was
furtively carrying it up to her grandfather’s bedroom.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Set ye down,” repeated the Gaffer. “Have a glass o’ beer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you, I’ve had water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the glass too,” the old man chuckled. “That ain’t
much of a chate. Have a shiver o’ cake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will did not like to refuse the slice till the Gaffer, after looking
round with growing grumpiness, brought in the great wedding-cake
from the kitchen, naked of its carton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muddlin’ things away,” he was murmuring, as he posed it
pompously on the table, whence its high-built glory of frosted
sugar shed a festal air over the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you!” cried Will hastily, divining a mistake—on
the Gaffer’s part, if not on Jinny’s. He guessed Farmer Gale
was concerned with it, for the whole countryside was agog with the
meanness of a wedding that did not include a labourers’ supper,
nay, even a holiday for them. The old man glared, bread-knife
in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would give me stomach-ache,” Will apologized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The confession arrested the ancient. “Never had gullion in
my life,” he bragged, laying down the bread-knife. “But you
young folks——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like this,” said Will, taking advantage of this better
mood. “There’s not enough business to keep both of us going.
Suppose I buy you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buy me out!” The prophet of wrath resurged. His arm
shot out for the bread-knife, pointing it door ward. “Git out
o’ my house. For a hundred year——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will got angry. “If I do get out, it <span class='it'>will</span> be a hundred years
before I come back. However,” he said, forcing a smile, “let’s
put it another way. Jinny shall come and help <span class='it'>my</span> business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny’ll never give up Methusalem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Methusalem’ll give up Jinny before very long—he
can’t last for ever. And she can keep him for Sundays—yes,
that’ll be a good idea. She can drive to chapel with him, not
being a business animal.” “And then she’d be clear of successors
to Farmer Gale,” a side-thought added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Oi thought ’twas me you had a proposition for,” said
the Gaffer testily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will hastily readjusted his tactics. “Of course, of course.
It’s really lumping our businesses, instead of competing, don’t
you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dedn’t Oi say ’twas a pardnership you was arter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite right. Only we’ll give poor old Methusalem a retiring
pension.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He, he!” croaked the Gaffer. He added honestly, “But Oi
don’t droive much meself nowadays. ’Tis onny the connexion
ye’d be getting and the adwice and counsel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I want,” said Will enthusiastically. “And I’m
willing to share and share alike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Snacks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Snacks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not a bad notion,” admitted the ancient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a ripping notion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arter all, as you say, there’s no reason we should come into
colloosion.” He dropped the knife back on the table, and looked
out of the still open window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, it’s a grand coach!” he gurgled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The talk of the countryside—only needs a turnpike road to
beat the train!” said Will, expanding afresh. “Snowdrop and
Cherry-blossom I call these horses for fun—because they’re so
black, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, black as the devil! And hark at ’em pawin’—there’s
fire and sperrit for you. That’s as foine a coach as ever Oi took
up from. It’ll not look amiss with Quarles painted ’stead o’
Flynt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” said Will quickly. “Flynt must
remain. The Flynt Flyer—you can’t alter that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t say the Quarles Flyer—the Quarles Creeper runs
better off the tongue. The Flynt Flyer—that goes together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s you and me’s got to goo together,” retorted the
obstinate old man. “Anyways it must be the Quarles and
Flynt Flyer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s too long. Besides the Flynt Flyer’s become a trade-mark—known
everywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about Daniel Quarles, Carrier? That’s a better
known trade-mark. We’ll paint that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will shook his head. “I can’t do that, but I’ll paint Flynt
and Quarles, Carriers, underneath the name of the coach. And
that’s the limit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daniel Quarles was always a peaceable man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Quarles
and Flynt!” breathed the Gaffer beatifically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Flynt and Quarles,” Will corrected. “Flynt must go
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why must?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t F come before Q? Folks would think we didn’t
know our A B C.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>would</span> be more scholardy,” Daniel admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will proffered a conclusive hand. “Then it’s a bargain!”
But Daniel let the hand hover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi don’t droive much meself nowadays,” he repeated with
anxious honesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t expect it of the head of the firm,” said Will grandly;
“there’s substitutes and subordinates.” But his hand drooped
with a sense of bathos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay,” said the old man, swelling, “subordinators and granddarters.”
He fished for the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oughtn’t we to let ’em know?” Will insinuated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi allus liked young Flynt, your father,” answered the
Gaffer, squeezing his fingers heartily. “And there warn’t much
amiss with your mother. A forthright family, aldoe Peculiar.
Jinny droives a-Sundays to chapel with the buoy-oys!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At which sudden failure—or rather resurgence—of memory,
Will felt more urgently than ever the need of getting Jinny’s
consent rather than the nonagenarian’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re mighty lucky,” he said craftily, “to have a granddaughter
so spry. I reckon we’d better have her down and tell
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, that Oi be,” replied the Gaffer. “ ’Tis heartenin’ to
hear her singin’ up and down the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed a little silvery trill was reaching them now. To Will it
recalled more than one moment of mockery, but he felt nothing
provocative in this song except its parade of happiness. It
seemed to fling back his compassion, to be ominous of a refusal
of his proposition. Perhaps, on second thoughts, it might be
better to leave the old man to present her with a finished fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must be getting home,” he said. “Glad that’s
settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel clutched the knife again. “And we’ll cut the cake
upon it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no.” Mistake or no mistake, it seemed sacrilegious to
slice into this quasi-ecclesiastical magnificence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s a bargain. Jinny shall cut it. Jinny!” he called up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just coming, Gran’fer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s too grand for a bargain,” Will remonstrated. “Would
almost do for a wedding,” he added with sly malice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ain’t this for a pardnership?” the old man cackled.
He moved to the door and stood looking out on the horses.
“Steady, my beauties,” he said proprietorially. He shuffled to
them and rubbed a voluptuous hand along the satiny sheen of
their skins. “Flynt and Quarles,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will had taken the opportunity to escape from the house. He
now prepared to light his lamps. Bats were swooping and
darting, weaving their weird patterns, but the air was still
uncooled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’re not a-gooin’ afore the cake’s cut!” the Gaffer protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d best not see Jinny—she might only fly at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbidge. When we’ve made it up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m late, and I shouldn’t wonder if there’s a thunderstorm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t take half a jiffy!” He dashed into the house and
seized the knife. Will was only in time to arrest his uplifted
arm, and Jinny, descending on the tableau, had a tragi-comic
sense of rushing betwixt a murderer and her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing, Gran’fer?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He surrendered the bread-knife blinkingly to her, and Will
released his arm, struck breathless by the change in Jinny. Not
only were apron and shabby gown replaced by the Gentry
masterpiece, not only was her hair combed and braided in a
style he had never seen, but the face which reduced all these
fripperies to insignificance seemed years younger and fresher.
The little lines were gone from the forehead, the hard defiance
from the eyes, and the wanness from the cheeks: the whole face
was mantled with a soft light. How shrewd he had been to
suggest this partnership, he thought with a pleasant glow, forgetting
its origin in pity. For assuredly this softly radiant
person made no call on that emotion. The old man was equally
astonished. “Why, Jinny, ye’re as smart as a carrot!” he cried
naïvely. “Bless ye.” He kissed her fondly. “Willie wants to
goo into pardnership—Quarles and Flynt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young people looked at each other, both as carrots in hue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Willie, where’s your tongue? Tell her how we’ve
settled it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can tell me on Sunday,” said Jinny, not utterly unresentful
of their masculine methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On Sunday?” the Gaffer gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After chapel,” Jinny explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi won’t have no such talk a-Sundays. It’s got to be now.
Goo ahead, buoy-oy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Gran’fer,” Jinny pleaded. “Can’t you go and light
Will’s lamps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye want to upset it all behind my back,” he said with a
cunning air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye can’t diddle Daniel Quarles. It’s a fust-rate proposition,
and don’t ye dare say ‘Noa.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Gran’fer!” Jinny hung her head. “You might understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi understand better nor you. Look at that coach now—a
grand coach—Quarles and Flynt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind the coach—light the lamps,” Jinny cried
paradoxically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel moved out reluctantly. “It’s a hansum proposition,
Jinny,” he said. “Where’s your tinder-box, Willie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s matches,” said Will. He looked uneasy. Her grandfather
seemed to be irritating the girl—it boded ill for his
proposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be afeared, Willie. She won’t fly at ye now. Easy,
my beauties. Steady, Snowdrop!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mind my clearing up,” said Jinny, pouncing upon
Farmer Gale’s imperilled cake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if you don’t fly at me,” Will quoted with a nervous
facetiousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny smiled with equal nervousness: “Oh, I won’t fly at
you—nor jump at you, neither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will flinched. Had he not felt committed to her grandfather,
he would have shrunk from the rebuff now menacing his proposition.
Indeed, he was not quite clear as to how he could really
amalgamate the two concerns. The notion of a girl guard, which
had first flashed upon him as an inspiration, was now felt to be
beset by obstacles. True, the operations of blowing such a long
horn, taking so many fares, booking so many parcels, and locking
and unlocking the boots, were a serious discount from the
pleasures of driving, and a person familiar with the minutiæ of
carrying, and a ready-reckoner incarnate, (and so agreeably
incarnate) might well seem providential. But would the unfitness
of so unconventional an occupation be glossed over by the
existing acceptance of her in that line of business, and would
his overlordship be a protection or an added scandal? Still, he
was in for it now, unless she refused the post—which he hoped
she would not! For after all, at the worst, with all these new
circuits of his, he might still leave to her her little pottering round,
counting it as a branch of the new Flynt and Quarles business.
He would still have won the monopoly of the local carrying, and
without the weight on his conscience of starving her out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you’ve got a deal of pride and all that,” he began
diffidently, “but you’ll bear in mind your grandfather’s tickled
with the notion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hardly Gran’fer’s business,” Jinny murmured, blushing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I quite understand that. Of course it’s your business
really. Didn’t I ask you not to run away? I didn’t mean to
reckon it settled unless <span class='it'>you</span> said ‘Yes.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should hope not,” said Jinny with a spirit that banished
the blush. She carried the cake back to the top of the chest of
drawers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it’s silly our going on separate, don’t you think
so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t thought.” She took up the beer-jug to remove
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I have—I’ve thought a good deal—that’s why I figured
that with you as my partner—No, not for me, thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Jinny was mechanically filling a glass. Flushing afresh,
she poured the beer back. “But who’s to look after Gran’fer?”
she said, her eyes averted. “How can I leave him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve thought of that—naturally when you’re so much with
me, you can’t be much with him. But, you see, there’ll be
plenty of dollars to share out—money, I mean—and we’d be
able to get in a woman to take care of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To get in a woman! So he was prepared to let poor old
Gran’fer live with them! O exquisite, incredible magnanimity!
It solved all difficulties in a flash. “And what about Methusalem?”
she asked, expectant of a similarly sublime solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old Methusalem!” he laughed. “Won’t he like going
to grass? Well, if he’s so very keen, suppose he trots around
once a week on his own little affairs—hair-restorers and the
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the little dart failed to pierce. She was overwhelmed by
this culminating magnanimity. This was indeed surrender. So
she was <span class='it'>not</span> ignorant of horses, so her work had <span class='it'>not</span> been improper.
She smiled responsively, but her voice shook. “You mean I
can carry on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Under the Flynt flag, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t really mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All’s grist that comes to the mill. Besides, it would leave
me free to branch out to Totfield Major, and perhaps even
Colchester. Tuesdays, say, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she did not like. Her conception of a wife’s dignity
boggled at the notion of driving around as before. Unmaidenly
it was not—he had handsomely admitted it—but unwifely it
assuredly was. A wife’s place, she felt instinctively, was the
home. She shook her head. “I don’t think I ought to drive
Methusalem any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gasped. “Well, you wouldn’t expect to handle a <span class='it'>pair</span> of
horses, would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If he meant she could not, Jinny was not so sure. But why
argue so irrelevant a point? “No, of course not,” she murmured
obediently. “I mean Methusalem <span class='it'>will</span> like going out to
grass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He breathed freely again. The path to his project was clear
at last. “But as a sort of guard now——” he ventured, With
an indulgent air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny beamed at so facetious a picture. She saw herself in
red, with big buttons and shorn hair. “So I’m to blow your
horn for you after all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure—once you’ve paid up the gloves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed merrily. Even Miss Gentry’s bill was a dissipated
nightmare now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where shall I get the money?” she joked, for the pleasure
of his reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’ll take all the money,” he instructed her seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to allow you some, though,” she pointed out
gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half,” he explained. “We divide the takings equally—that’s
my proposition. Snacks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s much too much,” she protested as seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The apparent admission pleased him, but increased his sense
of magnanimity. “Share and share alike,” he repeated magnificently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t want to spend half the takings,” Jinny persisted.
“How could I manage on a half?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you’ll have much more than you ever had!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was mystified. “But there’ll be the house to keep up
and—and——” She paused with shy flaming cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was getting a bit puzzled too. “And your grandfather?
But I’ve already offered to pay for him and his minder too—out
of the joint takings, I mean. Surely half and half is the most
you can expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it showed once more how little our Jinny had really been
changed from early-Victorian womanhood by her exceptional
experiences, that so unconventional a system of joint housekeeping
made no appeal to her. “A quarter is the most <span class='it'>you</span> can
expect,” she retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” Will was even more revolted by her ingratitude
than by her impudence. “When you only bring in your wretched
little cart, and I sank all my capital in the coach!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your capital?” Jinny repeated blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what I had to pay for the horses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an unfortunate memory to stir up, and it helped a
flood of raw light to burst upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not really proposing I should be your guard?” she
asked in a changed voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am,” he reassured her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For money?” she breathed incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. You don’t suppose I ask it for love! Business
is——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny turned on him like a tigress—anger was the only thing
that could drown this dreadful sense of shame. “How dare
you?” she cried. “How dare you ask me to work for you
for money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will winced before her passion. “You promised not to fly at
me,” he reminded her glumly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t think you’d suggest that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what’s wrong in suggesting a partnership?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A partnership!” she sneered. “Do you suppose I’m going
to pull you out of the mud?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will’s blood was up in its turn. “You pull <span class='it'>me</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else? You find yourself stuck and you come to me
to save your funeral coach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funeral coach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Gran’fer calls it. And you <span class='it'>will</span> find yourself
carrying corpses if you go on cooping up your passengers in this
weather. Your silly concern hasn’t got a tilt to take off, but at
least you might put the luggage inside and the live-stock on top.
Oh, don’t be frightened, I won’t charge for my advice. But you
being young and raw——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! Stow that!” Will banged the floor with his whip.
“Then you refuse my offer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Offer? I call it a petition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me petitioning——!” His breath failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t me that came with a flag of truce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He snorted. “You’ll come one day with a cry for mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me! You’ll never see <span class='it'>me</span> at Frog Farm. I’d rather go to
the poorhouse—to see you, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will set his teeth. “Very well then—my conscience is clear.
I did think I might have been hard on you. But now——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” she echoed mockingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall crush you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed tauntingly “Pride goes before a fall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall crush you without pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You young rapscallion!” It was the Gaffer hobbling back.
Having lit the coach-lamps, he had lingered in voluptuous contemplation
of what they illumined. But the noise of high words
had reached him, and now with the astonishing muscularity that
still lingered in his shrunken frame, the ancient seized the whip
and wrenched it from Will’s grasp. Jinny flew between them,
fearing he would strike as he stood there in prophetic fury,
palpitating in his every limb. Her earlier intervention, though
against a knife, had been comic: here was tragedy, she felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You crush my Jinny! Why, Oi’ll snap ye in two like this
whip.” And he hurled the pieces of the stock at Will’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nip leapt for the butt-end and brought it back in his mouth
with high-wagging tall, demanding another throw. He broke
the tension of foolish mortality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t excite yourself, Gran’fer,” said Jinny, leading him to
his chair. “I’ll cut him out before he’s a month older.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will guffawed. “I offered her a fair chance, Mr. Quarles,” he
said, taking the butt from Nip’s mouth. “You yourself said it
was a handsome offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t want your offers, ye pirate thief, nor your chances
neither. Ye’ve only got our crumbles. Oi’ve sent a mort o’
customers to hell, and you can goo with ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you please.” Will picked up the whip-end quietly. But
the old volcano was still rumbling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You crush my Jinny—you with your flags and rags. Why,
all Bradmarsh ’ould give ye rough music. Ye’d be tin-kettled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well! Only don’t say I didn’t give you a fair and
friendly chance. Don’t blame me if you come to want bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bread!” The old man sprang towards the chest of drawers
and this time the cake was stabbed to the heart. “Have a
shiver?” he cried magnificently, holding up a regal hunk on the
knife-point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even Will was taken aback by this deed of derring-do. “Better
save it up,” he said sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save it?” repeated Daniel hysterically. Nip was already
on his hind legs begging for it—with a superb gesture the prodigal
grandfather threw it at the tireless mouth. “Never you darken
my doorstep again!” he cried to Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will cracked his bit of whip with a scornful laugh. “Before
you see me in this house again, you’ll have to carry me in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carry him in? D’ye hear that, Nip?” The ancient
chuckled contemptuously. “That’s a good ’un.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carry me in,” repeated Will fiercely. And holding up his
hand, “So help me God!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spare your swearings, buoy-oy,” said Daniel grimly, throwing
the plaintive Nip another pile of sugary splendour. “Ye
’ont never cross this threshold agen save on your hands and
knees.” And sending his knife quivering into the floor, he brought
down his hand on his Bible. “On your hands and knees,” he
repeated solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will turned and strode out stiffly. He looked almost tall. A
moment later they heard the clatter and jingle of the great
equipage moving forwards and the jubilant winding of the long
horn.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Normally</span> the nonagenarian preserved scant memory of the
happenings of the present, vivid though his youthful recollections
were: But the great wedding-cake, served up at every meal for
days, co-operated with the intensity of the scene to stamp his
quarrel with Will upon his feebly registering brain. Especially
did Nip’s standing supplication for his quota revive and deepen
the impression. “On your hands and knees!” he would cry
savagely, as he threw the lucky dog a luscious morsel. And
even when Nip was absent at meal-times—as his mistress contrived
more than once, in her anxiety to pamper neither him nor
her grandfather’s resentment—the old man would growl grimly:
“Carry him in!” Aching enough at heart from her own
quarrel with Will, she had the wretched feeling that if by some
impossibility she and her rival could ever again come together,
the grotesque oaths of these two obstinate males would keep the
family breach unhealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But sentiment cannot retain its acuteness under business
worries and carking household cares. The rich cake eaten
through so monotonously became to Jinny a sort of ironic
symbol of the declining fortunes of Blackwater Hall. It contributed
indeed no little to the decay of the old business, not
merely by the great sum that had to be paid to the confectioner,
but through the loss of the considerable customer whose hymeneal
festivities its absence overgloomed. Marie Antoinette’s advice
to the starving to eat cake did not come into the Spelling-Book,
otherwise Jinny might have reflected how near they were come
to adopting it. Not that her grandfather had as yet occasion
to suspect the bareness of the larder. Unlike Mother Hubbard
he never went to the cupboard, the cupboard always comfortably
coming to him. Moreover, some rabbits shot by the farmers as
the falling crops uncovered them, and presented to the ancient
by annual custom, served to postpone the evil day. Jinny was
hardly conscious how much she stinted herself for his sake, so
poor was her appetite become. It was only once—-when passing
the big Harvest Dinner barn where Farmer Gale’s men roared
drunken choruses—that she felt a craving for food. This
valuable freedom from hunger she attributed to the heat: in
the winter, she told herself, she could always stoke for the week
at the Tuesday and Friday meals so amiably provided at Mother
Gander’s. That worthy lady would also doubtless refill grandfather’s
beer-barrel at cost price. It was fortunate he did not
smoke or snuff. Methodism had its points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A more serious problem was presented by Methusalem—growing
distended by overmuch grass—and even her goats
coveted an occasional supplement to the hedgerows and the oak
scrub if their milk was to run freely. But of hay or cabbages
her store was small, and these finicking feeders, though they
condescended to eat horse-chestnuts, would not even accept a
gnawed apple. The poultry, too, must soon be eaten, if they
could not be properly fed, and the thought of instructing her
grandfather to twist a familiar neck made her blood run cold.
With such a varied household to cater for, our little housekeeper
began to envy Maria, who, according to Mrs. Flynt, raised her
large and frequent families on everything and anything on earth,
rhubarb-leaves being the one and only pabulum pigs turned up
their snouts at. It was not the least painful part of this novel
pinch of poverty that Jinny felt herself compelled to forgo those
calls with little presents for the Pennymoles, the Bidlakes, and
the poor and the bed-ridden in general, with which she had
diversified her deliveries: she did not realize that her mere
presence would have been a creature comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of these pangs and problems the world knew naught, hearing
her little horn making its gay music and seeing her still jauntily
perched on her driving-board in her elegant rose-pink frock and
with the latest fancy whipcord edge to the straw of her bonnet.
Her music, indeed, was far livelier than the wheezy notes of the
Flynt Flyer’s guard, though otherwise the red-coated clodhopper
who had been stuck up on the coach a few days after its visit
to Blackwater Hall, lent the last touch to its fascinations. But
if passengers, other than Elijah Skindle and one or two equally
unbusinesslike young men, were no longer content to crawl along
in her cart, that historic vehicle showed scant sign of defeat.
Already when the removal of the hoops in the hot weather had
threatened to expose too clearly the nakedness of the land,
parcels of stones on the model of the swain-chaser had begun to
cumber it up, and when one Monday morning the Flynt Flyer
came swaggering in new pea-green paint, the Quarles Crawler
turned up on Tuesday mountainous with the old boxes and
cypress clothes-chests routed out of the ante-room, and emptied
of their litter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this point that the Gaffer had had to be put into the
plot. He had long since begun to smell a rat—having a super-sense
for his business, however his other senses might fail—and
it would have been impossible to heave up the boxes without
him, or to explain their removal without imparting some notion of
the tragic truth. And the truth did not diminish his resentment
against young Caleb’s boy or his vigilance against further robbers.
“Carry him in!” he would cackle and croak as he bore out the
emptied “spruce-hutches” to the cart or carefully permutated
their positions in it. Then with hoarse thunder: “On your hands
and knees, ye pirate thief!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these ostentated boxes—while they saved the pride of the
Quarleses—did but damage the remainder of their custom. The
faithful few had been held back by solicitude for Jinny’s livelihood:
seeing her now so flourishing, the very tail-board lowered
on its chains and groaning under protruding “portmantles,” her
last clients save Peculiars lapsed in silent relief, one after another.
Daily, poor Jinny expected to see four horses on the rival vehicle
and its circuit extended to Colchester. But that would have
meant for Will a grandeur inconsistent with the petty commissions
which he still deigned to execute: it would have allowed
some of her old custom to return to her. And he was sullenly
bent on driving her—literally—out of the business. But he
enhanced the dignity of his profession by copying from an old
inn of the pack-horse days its signboard of “The Carriers’ Arms,”
depicting a rope, a wanty-hook, and five packing skewers. These,
painted in black on the pea-green, seemed to proclaim his formal
annexation and monopoly of the local carrying trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny began to think seriously of buying up from the barns
some straw from the reaped sheaves and competing with the
cottagers in the all-pervasive plaiting industry. Splitting straws
was no despicable occupation in the valley of the Brad, where it
was done by enginery, and provided even children of six and
old men of eighty with the opportunity of adding to the family
income. Tambour-lace and other things also entered into her
thoughts. The only thing that never entered into them was
the idea of ceasing to ply. So long as the boxes and the cart
held together, the Flynt Flyer should always see the rival
vehicle imperturbably jogging. In every sense she would
“carry on.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>August was ending aridly. Methusalem’s sensitive nose was
protected from flies by green bracken. Calves snuggled in the
hot meadows, meditatively chewing, an image of somnolence,
their tails flicking whitely. Stooks or manure-heaps had reduced
the fields to geometrical patterns. Tall hollyhocks leaned
dustily like ruined towers. Bucolic conversation was of the
absent rain. Rooks were more destructive than ever. Swedes
were doing badly and every one had waited to sow turnips, rape,
or mustard. They had no fodder even for winter stock. Master
Peartree began to worry over his sheep as they munched the
sapless grass. In the waterless little villages the ground was
hard as iron, and Bundock strode over the swamps around Frog
Farm as fearlessly as now frequently. “A regular doucher”
was the general demand upon Providence, though it was couched—for
church and chapel—in less vivid terms. These prayers
enabled Bundock to work off one of his old aphorisms, saved for
a rainless day. “It’s no use praying for rain,” he chuckled to
the countryside, “till you see the storm-clouds.” “But you
don’t scarce need to pray then,” the countryside pointed out, to
his disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Jinny’s soul, too, there was drought, and she seemed to
share Bundock’s view that prayer was waste of breath. Not
that her evening prayers were left unsaid, but in her apathy and
weariness no private plea was added to the prescribed form,
though the Spelling-Book commended the asking for extra mercies,
provided also one begged for a perpetual continuance of the
Protestant Succession. What deliverance could there be for
her? God Himself, she felt obscurely, could not help her, any
more than she had ever been able to help little mavises fallen
from their nests and deserted by their mothers. Their thrilling-eyed
vitality and exquisite flutterings had only made her
miserable. But perhaps God was now as sorry for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One grown-up mavis, too, she remembered, a victim to the
winter battle of life, the neck half severed from the half-plucked
body, the liquid eye gazing appealingly at her, the legs stirring
feebly in a welter of feathers. She had nerved herself to grant
its dumb plea: she had stamped sharply on its skull and seen
its eye fly out on the path like a bright bead. Could God do
aught less drastic for her? Not that she ever dreamed of dying:
she must live on, however mutilated, for it was impossible to
conceive her grandfather getting along without her. Consider
only his trousers! How loosely they were now flapping round
his shrunken calves, almost like a sailor’s. Soon the winter
winds would be piping through them. Without her to take in
a tuck, where would he be? And who would cut his hair and
trim his beard?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was her grandfather who was mainly responsible for the discontinuance
of her chapel habit on Lord’s Day. His increased
fretfulness and fractiousness since he was become aware of the
rival power, made it imprudent to leave him for long except
unavoidably—not to mention the danger to herself of awkward
meetings at chapel with that rival power—and there was the
further difficulty of getting to Chipstone, now Farmer Gale’s trap
was out of the question. But she was not without a nearer place
of worship—for to the scandal of the Peculiars, particularly
Bundock, she now began to attend the parish church of Little
Bradmarsh, whose emptiness with its parade of free seats after
eleven o’clock was a standing pleasantry in the spheres of Dissent.
The convenience of proximity was not, however, its main attraction
for Jinny, and Miss Gentry would have rejoiced less had
she understood that a change of heart or doctrine or the magnetism
of the Reverend Mr. Fallow had as little to do with
Jinny’s apparent conversion; though the fact that Jinny had
never forgotten her one childish glimpse of the prayer-absorbed
pastor doubtless served to reassure the girl as to the not altogether
ungodly character of his edifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had entered to cart over to the Chipstone hospital some fruit
laid before the altar at the Harvest Thanksgiving by the one
prosperous worshipper. For Mr. Fallow was still an unwavering
client of hers, almost the last outside her own communion, possibly
because having neither family nor flock to distract him from his
classics, he had scarcely observed the coach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the “Speculi Britanniæ Pars,” in which he had once hunted
out her genealogy—to his own satisfaction and nobody’s hurt—Essex
was compared to Palestine for its flow of “milke and
hunny.” And “hunny” was still her staple link with the tall
fusty-coated, snuff-smeared figure, stooping over his hives or his
Virgil, both sacredly fused for him in the Fourth Georgic. She
marketed his surplus, exchanging it for firkins of butter and—O
aberrations of the godliest—canisters of Lundy Foot. And it
was after disposing of some of his smaller tithes—for the parish
had remained outside the recent Commutation Act of 1836—that
Jinny had been thus led to set foot in his church. There
were in those days no floral decorations to mar the completeness
with which the arches and pillars ministered to her troubled
mood. The outside she had always found soothing, with its
grey old stonework and its lichened tower rising amid haystacks
and thatched cottages with dormer windows. But how much
cooler the peace that fell upon her, when she passed through the
old, spiky, oak door and under the long, wooden, vaulted roof into
a dimness shot with rich stained glass. Mr. Fallow had been
one of the earliest clergymen of the century to remove the
whitewash from the old painted walls of his church, and though
the royal arms—the lion and the unicorn—still lingered over the
chancel, there was no other jar in the spiritual harmony except
the stove, whose pipe went hideously up and along the ceiling.
Ignoring that, however, in the effect of the whole and forgetting
everything else, Jinny sank upon a pew-bench and abandoned
herself to the unholy influences of architecture, so restful after
her chapel with its benches and table-desk, ugliness unadorned.
Not even a gradual consciousness of neglected duty could impair
the divine tranquillity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the sober beauty of the place might not have sufficed to
draw her again, but for a strange circumstance. One of the
stained-glass figures, dully familiar to her from without as a
leaden glaze, proved when seen from within in all the glory of
art to be an angel of the very type under which her childish
vision had imagined her hovering mother. And that it actually
was mystically interfused with her mother, as her emotion had
immediately intertwined it, was demonstrated by the fact that
even when she at last went forward to gather up the plums and
apples, the eyes followed her about in protection and benediction.
Miss Gentry’s legend of her moving angel lost its last shade of
improbability, and it was with a new humility that Jinny repeated
to her at the first opportunity her remorse for the permuted
pot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did the angel’s emanation of guardianship prove
illusory, for outraged though Miss Gentry had been by the
suggestion that her moustache needed a hair-restorer, she
graciously intimated—after the second Sunday of Jinny’s
attendance—that the debt for the dress could be worked off in
commission charges. It was a vast relief, for the Bundock-borne
rumour of her apostacy had alienated the bulk of her co-religionists
and exchanged the lingering remorse of earlier deserters
for a sense of rectitude and foresight. Bundock’s sympathy
with the Brotherhood almost reinstated him in its good graces.
“But it brings its own punishment,” he pointed out consolingly.
“Fancy putting a parson over herself to poke his snuffy nose
into everything. That’s a pretty dress, Jinny, he’ll say, is it
paid for? Or, that’s a cranky old grandpa you’ve got—why
don’t ye put him in the poorhouse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as well poor Jinny did not overhear him, or she might
have doubted whether her load of boxes was so uniformly imposing
as she imagined. The Deacon, who did hear him, and who spent
his life poking into holes and reprimanding sinners, was even
more righteously indignant at the interference of parsons. “Inquisitive
as warmin in a larder,” he described them. “Fussing
around the poor, but without a drop of rum in their milk of
human koindness.” Mr. Fallow—it would appear—had interfered
on behalf of his parishioner in the threatened lawsuit with
Miss Gentry: he had persuaded the guileless rat-catcher to
promise to clear her cottage for nothing, and this although Mrs.
Mott was paying her in full for his wife’s silk dress, the responsibility
for which he had righteously repudiated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oi’ll</span> clear her cottage,” he added darkly, and it seemed to
Bundock that the parson had succeeded only in patching up the
feud. But what was to be expected of the canting crew, the
postman inquired. The new Chipstone curate had called on his
father, and Bundock related with a chuckle how the bed-ridden
old boy had patronizingly regretted that, being on his back, he
could do nothing to help his visitor. “He sent him away with
a bed-flea in his ear,” gloated Bundock. Mr. Joshua Mawhood
recalled a bigger flea in the same clerical ear. The hapless
curate had offered him a ticket for a lecture on “Economy.”
“Come with me Bradmarsh way,” the rat-catcher had retorted,
“and Oi’ll show you Mrs. Pennymole’s cottage, and if you’ll
show me how she can bring up her nine childer on eleven shillings
a week, Oi’ll eat your shovel-hat.” Bundock, unable to find a
still larger flea, fell back on hypothesis. “If I’d been a Churchman
and a chap in a white choker came to mine,” he said, “I’d
tell him to mind his own business, and I dare say he’d be insulted,
though I’d be giving him splendid advice. You know where the
door is, I’d say, for you didn’t come in by the chimney. Now
walk out, or else——!” And carried away by his own drama,
Bundock administered a hearty kick to the apparently still-lingering
phantom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Needless to say, Mr. Fallow exercised none of this imagined
prying into Jinny’s affairs. Like his pew-opener, whose long
caped coat with the official red border found now a fresh justification,
he was only too glad of her uninvited attendance, and the
considerable accretion she brought to his congregation. Her
presence freshened up for himself his old sermons: for her sake
he even put in new Latin quotations. But Jinny enjoyed
more the three musicians in the gallery—’cellist, flautist, and
bassoonist—whose black frock-coats and trousers made them as
important in quality as they were in quantity, and when after
they had played a few bars the congregation sang:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“<span class='it'>Awake my soul, and with the sun</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>Thy daily stage of duty run,</span>”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Jinny felt herself rapt far indeed from her daily stage of duty.
Even the pew-opener shuffling about in his list slippers to poke
up the stove or a small boy, or to snuff the guttering tallow
candles on dark mornings, could not bring her to earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And another factor than the church and its mother-angel
helped Jinny over this dreary time. This was her dog. For
only now did Nip emerge into his full caninity, or at least only
now did Jinny learn to appreciate him to the full. In howsoever
leaden a mood she started her carrying work, Nip’s ecstasy soon
tinged it with gold. His blissful staccato barks, his tall inflated
tail, his upleapings at her as she harnessed Methusalem, his
gallopings and gambollings round that stolider fellow-quadruped,
his crazy friskings and curvetings—who could resist such joy of
life? Often it seemed to Jinny that he was returning thanks to
his Maker for the sunshine or the good smells, rebuking unconsciously
her heart-heaviness, bidding her cry no more over spilt
milk, but just lap up what she could. “Cheer up, Jinny!” she
heard him bark. “Men are brutes and women fools and gran’fers
grumpy and customers cruel, but life is jolly and odours numerous
and where there’s a way there’s a Will.” And infected by these
sentiments of his, she would crack her whip, and Methusalem
would prick up his ears and pretend for her sake to go faster,
and there would be a lull in the ache at her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nip, however, was less consoling when the rival carriers met
on the road. Then his invincible persuasion that the two were
one brought Jinny considerable discomfort. For Will persisted
in his later tactics of slowing down, whether to take stock of her
appearance or to rub in the odious comparison of their respective
equipages, so that while these were in proximity, Nip was able
to feel himself shepherding them, and he ran from one to the
other, rounding them up. Even when Jinny manœuvred off
down the first by-way, Nip, not to be baulked, would travel
between one and the other, growing more and more desperate
as they grew more and more distant, till at last, fearful of losing
both, he exchanged his frenzied shuttling between them for a
still more frenzied standstill midway between the mutually
receding vehicles—you saw him almost literally torn in two.
Finally, after plaintive ululations of protest, he would trot back,
with hang-dog look and drooping tail, to the shabby cart, where
his mistress throned, grim and pale, amid her manifold mock
parcels.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But it was neither Mr. Fallows sermons nor Nip’s that gave
Jinny her first real sense of religion; not even the bass-viol and
flute, though she heard them with ecstasy, nor the collects and
litanies, though she perused them with interest. It came to her
one pitch-black night when she had too confidently ventured out
to bring first aid—a jug of real tea with some bread and butter—to
poor rheumatic Uncle Lilliwhyte, whom earlier that day, while
gathering mushrooms for supper, she had discovered in a deserted
charcoal-burner’s hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not known before that Farmer Gale had carried out
his threat of evicting the nondescript from his cottage on the
plea of needing it for a labourer, and although she had been
compelled to suspend the ministrations which had set Mr. Fallow
looking for the Lady Bountiful in her blood, she felt vaguely
responsible for Uncle Lilliwhyte’s declined fortunes, so parallel to
her own. Would, in fact, the Cornishman have turned him out
if Jinny had allowed that all-powerful arm to remain round her
waist at the cattle-market; nay, could she not have cheered and
nourished a subject countryside?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unsavoury ancient was lying on some coarse sacking in a
clearing still half charred. Literally “sackcloth and ashes,”
Jinny thought, as she groped her way along the glade by the
twinkle of his candle through the chinks of his ramshackle hut.
An old flintlock, some snares, nets and rods, and a cooking-pot
seemed all its furniture. She was horrified to think—as she
gazed at the gaps in the roof—that the prayer for rain might be
granted. But to her surprise the old man was sharing the
communal aspiration—“a good rine as’ll make the seeds spear”—though
not hopeful of the boon immediately. He did not
want to be a “wet-’ead,” he declared paradoxically, but the
ground would be harder before the sun met the wind. Such
solicitude on behalf of soil belonging so largely to the farmer who
had evicted him seemed to Jinny touchingly Christian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only when she had turned her back on his glimmering
light and got into the thick of the woods that they became
curiously unfamiliar. Great trees that she did not know existed
came colliding against her, tangles of roots tripped her up on her
favourite paths; she stumbled into unfriendly pricklinesses of
every species. She seemed, indeed, ridiculously lost within a
furlong of her own door: how this black labyrinth had got there
she could not understand, but it looked as if she might be all
night escaping from it. She was even uneasily expecting one of
the snakes Uncle Lilliwhyte hunted to glide perversely under
her feet, she bruising its head and it biting her heel as the curse
in Genesis predicted. Of course, if she could spit into its mouth
after chewing some Spanish bugloss, it would instantly die. So
at least Miss Gentry had assured her. But how find the rare
bugloss in this blackness, or how spit accurately into the serpent’s
mouth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why had she not brought a lantern, she asked herself. Was
it really because she was jug and package laden, or had it been only
conceit? She asked the question still more self-reproachfully
when, after smashing the empty jug in a stumble which left her
knuckles bleeding, she heard the gurgle of a water-hen and
realized that she was far off her track and nearly into the Brad.
She could not swim, but even a swimmer in such a moonless,
starless void would not see the shore. Cautiously feeling her
way among the willows, she groped towards the pasture-land,
paradoxically pleased when she fell over a sleeping cow. She
lay there some minutes in the warm darkness, not anxious to
move on, for the river wound perilously in and out, one could
still hear it rippling deliciously in the reeds, and the odours of
the night were as exquisite. And then through the measureless
blackness a faint suggestion of grey began to make itself perceptible
or rather divinable, so shadowy was it, a lesser shade of
black rather than an adumbration of light; it was as if behind
the blank firmament some star was striving to shine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly, mystically, she felt that this hinted radiance
was God, the Light behind life’s darkness, and the words of the
twenty-third Psalm came to her mind with all the force of a
revelation. “<span class='it'>The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He
maketh me lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the
still waters.</span>” How divinely apt was every word! So long as
she had not wanted for aught, so long as she had not needed to
be led, she had not really felt the meaning of the words: now
that she was strayed and a-hungered, she knew overpoweringly
that she had a shepherd. He was behind her watching, as surely
as she watched over her grandfather. Now she understood what
the Peculiars meant when they got up to testify. She must go
back to them, bear witness this very next Sunday. Mr. Fallow’s
church had no place for such testimonies. Women could not
speak even at Morning Service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as if to complete her conversion, there was a swift pattering,
a joyous bark, and a cold nose in her fevered palm. She had
only to attach her handkerchief to Nip’s collar to be guided
safely home. But it was Nip that was really her shepherd, she
told herself, or at least her sheep-dog: it was Nip that was
leading her beside the still waters. Dog was after all only God
spelt backwards, she thought, with a sense of mystic discovery.
And remembering all that Nip had done to bring her back to
faith in life, she felt he was indeed a divine messenger. But then
it was borne in upon her that if she testified her true thoughts,
the Brethren would deem her irreverent. After all, it was Mr.
Fallow who might understand better, he who spoke of his bees
with love, and had once cited to her a passage from a Roman
poet about bees being part of the divine mind. The Roman
writer was not a Catholic, he had explained carefully, seeing her
dubious face.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In her gratitude to the dressmaker, Jinny had become more than
ever her intellectual parasite, and a wealth of information from
“The Christian Mother’s Miscellany” and “Culpeper’s Herbal”—to
say nothing of the spinster’s own sibylline rhymes—enriched
the walk to and from church, which Miss Gentry graciously
permitted her carrier and debtor to take in her society next
Sunday morning. They parted indeed inside, Miss Gentry
plumping herself unrebuked into the curtained three-benched
pew of the dead and gone squire whom old Farmer Gale had dispossessed.
Jinny was thus unable to exchange glances with her
at the thrilling announcement read out by the cleric, who after
the Second Lesson declared curtly—as if it were the most natural
thing in the world—that Mr. Anthony Flippance, widower, of
Frog Farm, and Miss Bianca Cleopatra Jones, spinster, of Foxearth
Farm, both of this parish, proposed to enter into holy
matrimony. At once a whirligig of images circled round Jinny
and she saw dizzily the explanation of a disappearance that had
puzzled her, for Tony had vanished from “The Black Sheep”
without leaving a tip, the old waiter grumbled. What had led
up to this adventure, she wondered, and how was Polly taking
her intended stepmother?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that the Showman you’ve spoken of?” Miss Gentry
inquired, as the congregation of seven streamed out, swollen by
musicians, sexton, clerk, and pew-opener. “The fomenter of
ungodliness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly seems my old customer,” replied Jinny, somewhat
evasively. “But I didn’t know he was living at Frog
Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you tell me he was going to turn your chapel into a
playhouse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he said once, but nothing seems to have come of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More’s the pity,” Miss Gentry surprised Jinny by commenting.
She added, “Even a playhouse would do less harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I don’t see that,” Jinny stammered, protesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as clear as daylight. The Devil stamps his sign plainly
on a playhouse: he forges God’s name on a chapel. And who
is this Miss Jones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I never heard of any girl at Foxearth Farm
called Cleopatrick—what a funny name!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cleopatra,” corrected Miss Gentry grandly, her bosom
expanding till it strained her Sunday silk. “A great Queen of
Egypt in the days of old. Born under Venus and died of the
bite of an asp!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s an asp?” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s what they call the serpent of old Nile!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious!” Jinny exclaimed. “Couldn’t they have
given Her Majesty agrimony wine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither horse-mint nor wild parsnip could avail: there is no
ointment against suicide,” Miss Gentry explained. “She killed
herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A queen kill herself! What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does one kill oneself for?” Miss Gentry demanded
crushingly. “For love, of course. But I hope her namesake is
more respectable. Cleopatra never published the banns. But
how comes this Miss Jones to be at Foxearth Farm? I thought
the people were called Purley—hurdle-makers, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—it must be a lodger. They do take lodgers. I must
ask Barnaby—I meet him on the road sometimes.” She stood
still suddenly, going red and white by turns like the revolving
lens of a lighthouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry stared, then smiled in sentimental sympathy
“Is he a nice boy?” she cooed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who? Ye-es, very nice,” Jinny stammered. “But I’ve
just remembered Miss Jones isn’t his sister!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who said she was? Oh, Jinny, Jinny!” Miss Gentry
sometimes became roguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s only his stepsister,” Jinny explained desperately.
“Mrs. Purley’s first husband was called Jones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the bride should really be the Purley creature—the fair
charmer who rode so often in Will’s coach as to be almost
“keeping company” with him! What a lifting of a nightmare!
What a sudden horizon of rose! But no, it was too good to be
true!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I never heard she was called Cleopatra,” she wound up
sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People often have a second name hidden away like a tuck,”
said Miss Gentry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But her first name isn’t the same either, it’s Blanche.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Bianca <span class='it'>is</span> Blanche!” bayed Miss Gentry, like an excited
bloodhound. “Only more grand and foreign-like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s colours revolved again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” she breathed. But she remembered Mr. Flippance’s
address had been announced as Frog Farm. If he had thus
ousted young Mr. Flynt, she urged, how could he be living so
amicably under his rival’s roof? Besides, how should Mr.
Purley’s second wife, a matron as famous for her cheeses as her
spouse for his hurdles, have christened her girl so outlandishly?
No, Joneses were as abundant as hips and haws, and this Miss
Jones could only have come to their out-of-the-way parish—like
Mr. Flippance—for reasons of statutory residence, though why
the Showman should bury himself to be married, Miss Gentry
declared to be an exciting enigma. Perhaps he liked a quiet
wedding, Jinny suggested, having too many acquaintances in
towns, and with that she dismissed the hope from her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not so easy to dismiss the topic from Miss Gentry’s.
That lady was rolling the hymeneal discussion under her tongue.
She pointed out that Foxearth Farm was not in Little Bradmarsh
and was prepared to discuss the romantic ramifications, if it
should turn out on the wedding-day that the bride was disqualified.
But Jinny cruelly took the sweet out of her mouth.
Foxearth Farm <span class='it'>was</span> in the parish, she declared. “It’s one of
those funny bits, lost, stolen, or strayed into other parishes. I
know because of the women from there who come upon our
parish for blankets when they’re laid aside——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny!” deprecated Miss Gentry, to whom, maternity
was as sordid and surreptitious as matrimony was righteously
romantic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jinny, innocently misunderstanding, persisted. “Why, I
remember the fuss when the steam-roller tried to charge our parish
for doing up a scrap of the road beyond Foxearth Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked through the sunlit churchyard in constrained
silence, Miss Gentry feeling as if the steam-roller had gone over
roses. But stimulated by the iron pole and the four steps, by
which ladies who rode pillion anciently mounted and dismounted,
she began wondering who would be making the bride’s dress.
That gave Jinny a happy idea. How if she got Miss Gentry the
work—that would be a slight return for all she owed her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t <span class='it'>you</span> make it?” she inquired excitedly. “I
could speak to Mr. Flippance, now that I know where he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, child, don’t profane the Sabbath! Men don’t count
in wedding matters,” said Miss Gentry in complex correction.
“Nor would I care about the patronage of stage people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she mayn’t be stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like runs to like,” Miss Gentry sighed, and Jinny felt the
Colchester romance hovering again. But it did not descend.
Instead, Miss Gentry remarked that she ought to have known
that it could not be a local beauty. No play-actor with any
brains at all could be attracted by anything hereabouts, especially
when they could not achieve the acquaintance of women of real
attraction and intellect, these preferring the company of cats to
that of strolling sinners. Nevertheless, far be it from her
wilfully to rob Jinny of a commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t thinking of my commission,” Jinny protested with
a little flush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t dream of it otherwise. Squibs and I need so little
and have more work than we can manage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Squibs?” Jinny murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The place is overrun with rats,” Miss Gentry explained.
“What will it be when the cold drives them in from the ditches?
However, fortunately that horrible old Mawhood stands compelled
to clear the cottage before winter. That was the compromise
our too kindly pastor let him off with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you told me. Shall I order the Deacon at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Deacon?” Miss Gentry sniffed. “Bishops they’ll call
themselves next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There <span class='it'>is</span> a bishop,” Jinny reminded her. “Bishop Harrod.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretched little rat-catchers!” Miss Gentry hissed. “Setting
themselves up against the Church Established. I’m so glad
you’re done with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not,” Jinny confessed shyly. “I’m still Peculiar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are, indeed!” Miss Gentry cried, startled. “Do you
mean to tell me that after the glorious privilege of sitting under
Mr. Fallow——!” Words failed her, and they also failed Jinny,
to whom this unfamiliar metaphor conjured up a puzzling
picture of the vicar perched on her Sunday bonnet. The girl was
the first to recover her breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gran’fer told me my mother wanted me to be Peculiar,” she
explained. “I can’t go against my Angel-Mother.” Then she
blushed prettily, never having mentioned the angel mother since
childhood, and feeling somehow as if she had profaned a sacred
secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If your angel mother was alive,” cried Miss Gentry with
conviction, “it’s to our church that she would come—to our
grand old church with its storied windows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A divine thrill ran through all Jinny’s frame. Her belief that
her mother and the painted angel were mysteriously one was
sealed. The oracle had spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry, swelling at her silence—Jinny heard the silk
crackling—felt herself indeed an oracle. Squibs had his pick of
the plates at that Sunday dinner, enjoying a Sabbath rest from
rats, and basking in his mistress’s lap, a black curled-up breathing
mass of felicity.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>As Jinny jogged along next Tuesday morning, diverging from
her usual beat to take in the hurdle-maker’s home, that lay—like
a geological “fault”—in the wrong parish, the plan that
formed itself in her mind was to approach the question of the
bride and the wedding-dress by way of Barnaby Purley, the
youth who had so chivalrously come to her rescue by delivering
at Uckford Manor the keg of oil overlooked by her on that memorable
journey with Elijah Skindle. It was because Foxearth
Farm possessed this hobbledehoy scion and a trap of its own
that Jinny had never done its marketing, nor come face to face
with the creature of whom with sidelong eye she caught tantalizing
glimpses in the Flynt Flyer. “Not bad-lookin’ ” was
the countryside’s appraisal of her, which was rather ominous,
indicating as it did considerable beauty, and conjoined as it was
with a rumour of easy conquests, culminating in the coach-owner.
But a good square look at her had not been attainable,
even on Sunday, for though the family was Church of England—Mr.
Giles Purley being even a churchwarden—it preferred to
worship in the parish church to which it did not parochially
belong. Jinny told herself she was hastening at this first opportunity
purely in Miss Gentry’s interest, for fear the bridal gown
had been ordered elsewhere. But she could not quite disguise
from herself her consuming anxiety to discover whether this
everyday Miss Jones was really a Cleopatra, though she called her
poignant emotion mere curiosity, and deemed herself as apathetic
at heart as the bumble-bees now crawling miserably about her
cart, which could be flicked into a feeble flight and drone, but
which soon relapsed into their torpor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth the suppressed hope of finding Blanche safely paired
with the Showman was now quickening her pulses and restoring
the wild rose to her cheeks. The September day, too, for all the
long-continued drought, and despite the drowsy bumble-bees,
was not devoid of animating influences, especially the delicious
smell of burnings from the fields, where men tossed from their
prongs brown masses of weed into red and smoking heaps, or
carried like merry devils fiery forks from one pile to another.
Monstrous fungi clove in pied picturesqueness to the elm-trunks,
and a hawthorn grove with its scarlet berries was like a vast
radiant smile. Overhead the sun, a shimmery thin-clouded
sphere, showed like an eye in a great white peacock’s wing. The
hips and blackberries were interfused in the hedges, the ivy
flowered on the squat church towers, the Virginia creepers were
reddening the cottages, and the dahlias grew tall in the little
front gardens. In the orchards the pear-trees and apple-trees
were heavy with fruit. Around them the turnip-fields looked
more like spreads of mustard, so thick were the slender yellow-flowering
stems pushing between the crop proper. And everywhere
was life; pecking poultry scattering before Methusalem’s
feet, and little frogs playing leapfrog; swarms of the Daddy-long-legs
and gigantic spiders, great quarrelling families of rooks,
quiet chewing cattle, pigs nosing for acorns or windfall apples,
hares or great rats or weasels scuttling across the road, partridges
straying fearlessly in the stubble, swallows darting unpromisingly
high, and when Jinny passed over the little brick bridge, at
which a black drainage-mill waved what seemed its four
crossed white combs, a pair of superb swans hissed their proud
protectiveness over a very drab cygnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Driving through an avenue of firs and hornbeam, and past a
dirty pond with two flagged mounds in the middle, she reached
the clearing where the hurdle-maker operated, with his farmhouse
for base of his combined industrial, agricultural, and pastoral
occupations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Giles Purley, a rosy-wrinkled apple-faced ancient, stood in
his shirt-sleeves, looking as pleasantly untidy as his farmyard,
which was full of felled logs and split wood, and bean and corn
stacks, and ramshackle sheds. He was planing off knots with
a bill-hook, and as Jinny drove up to the gate of the old timbered
red house, he greeted her with a cheery grumble at the drought
which forced such winter work prematurely upon him. Jinny
was abashed to find no pretext for her visit coming to her tongue,
so she stammered out that she wanted to see Barnaby, and the
droll look that twinkled across his father’s face sent her colour
up still higher. “Always wants a change, they youngsters,”
he chuckled benevolently, “whether ’tis of work or sweet-hearts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point Jinny became aware of Barnaby himself, who,
equally in his shirt-sleeves, was smiling sheepishly up at her from
the ditch which he was discumbering with a hook. “Lilies of
the walley they stick in their buttonholes,” went on his father
waggishly, “as if weeds was ever aught but weeds. There ain’t
one that showlders his sack o’ corn or sticks to his dearie. Sheep’s
eyes they can make, but as for sheep-hurdles——!” The note
was now earnest. It seemed an unpropitious moment to tackle
Barnaby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to make it more impossible, Blanche herself suddenly
bounded from the orchard, flourishing a great corroded pear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nipped thirteen!” she cried gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bad-lookin’,” forsooth! To Jinny she appeared in her
bloom and colour like a rich peach dipped in cream: overripeness
was the only flaw her beauty suggested to this girl in her teens.
But the chill at Jinny’s heart did not prevent her crying out with
equal gaiety, “What an unlucky number—for the wasps!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barnaby laughed adoringly from his ditch, Mr. Giles Purley
in simple joy of the slaughter. The pigs, he explained gleefully,
had gnawed at the pear-bags and Blanche was “wunnerful
masterous” at nipping the wasps as they crawled out of the
forbidden fruit. Asps, Jinny found herself thinking, would have
a bad time at such bold hands, though they made the Cleopatra
likelier—she slued her eyes round to see the rings on them, but
the engagement finger was hidden by the big pear, and Miss
Jones, her gaiety checked, was eyeing her like the intruder
she was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can kill two at once,” Barnaby called up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like you with the lasses,” flashed his father, to his confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nothing,” said Blanche coldly. “They haven’t time to
curl their tails round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who? The lasses?” asked Jinny, and to her relief the
beautiful Blanche vouchsafed a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t be stung if you don’t think you’ll be,” the girl
explained more cordially. Then, unable to retain the proud
secret longer, even from the Carrier, she burst forth, “I’m going
on the stage with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” Jinny gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only as a beginning, of course. ‘Bianca, The Bare-Handed
Wasp-Killer,’ it’ll be on the bills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbidge!” came explosively from Mr. Purley. “And
where will Mr. Flippance get the wapses in the winter? A circus-slut
indeed—I wonder what your mother can be thinkin’ of! And
what’s Mr. Honeytongue going to bill <span class='it'>you</span> as, Barnaby? Not
champion hurdle-maker, I’ll go gaff!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait till you see me,” said Barnaby with sullen mysteriousness.
“You don’t know a circus from a theaytre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll stick to your shackles and bolts,” said his parent
grimly, “and peel the bark off, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the mention of Mr. Flippance, Jinny’s heart beat fast: she
felt hovering on the verge of the revelation, and the Bianca and
the stage-project rekindled her hope. But Mr. Purley’s grievance
had to be worked off first. “They’re too lazy to peel the wood,”
he explained to Jinny. “But that’s the main thing for hurdles—to
strip ’em well against rain. Same as you was full-dressed
in a pouring rain—the time it ’ud take you to dry! If you was
naked now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dad!” Barnaby remonstrated, to his parent’s confusion,
and enjoyed this tit-for-tat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you expect Mr. Flippance, Mr. Purley?” Jinny
asked him hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he never comes in the mornings,” Blanche replied, and
this appropriation of the question seemed to Jinny to continue
the promise of Bianca and the stage-project.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then can I speak to—to his intended?” she flashed brilliantly,
with a clever smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s gone to her dressmaker,” said Blanche simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a double blow, and Jinny winced before it. In that
twinkling of her eye Blanche seemed years younger, diabolically
handsome, a nipper of buds as well as of wasps. But a worse
blow awaited her, for she had scarcely regained her composure
when the distant sound of a wheezy horn and a sense of an
impending avalanche brought Blanche into bounding activity
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there’s Will!” she exclaimed with a comic, happy
start. “And me not dressed yet!” And without a word to
the little Carrier, she ran gaily into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frantically clutching Nip who was about to spring to meet the
coach, Jinny cried vague thanks to the hurdle-maker and hurried
Methusalem down a by-way so narrow that she could hardly
squeeze through the untrimmed “werges” neglected of Barnaby.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When she heard the coach well on its way again on the Chipstone
road, with Blanche divined within, she found herself
possessed by an unexpected urging towards Mr. Flippance. She
had no real round any longer—only the hours to fill and her
grandfather to half deceive—and perhaps, despite Miss Gentry’s
own opinion, the bridegroom might yet be able to prevent her
being cut out by the rival pair of scissors. The truth was,
Jinny felt a physical need of the toning up the Showman somehow
imparted to life. To drive around the rest of the day with
practically no business but her own thoughts would be too
dreadful. He must surely babble happily about his bride, and
apart from the interest of her identity, some of his glow could
not but radiate to her. And there was Caleb and Martha to see,
too—how were they faring, these dear, simple creatures, too long
unvisited? But then—thought that froze the heart!—had she
not declared she would never set foot in Frog Farm again? No,
she answered herself defiantly—and no memory of hereditary
quibbling, nothing of her sense of humour, rose to trouble the
reply—all she had said was that Will should never <span class='it'>see</span> her there.
And Will was safely chained to the Chipstone road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the same she looked round apprehensively and with wildly
beating heart before she allowed Methusalem to lift the latch of
the familiar gate, and she had somehow expected so great a
transformation in the farmhouse under its new and sinister
activities, and was conscious of so vast a change in herself since
she had last seen it, that its primitive black front almost startled
her, so unchanged did it appear. True, the ferrets’ cages were
gone, but their absence only made it more its old self, and the
moan of the doves was as reassuring as the singing of the kettle
on her own hearth. Caleb’s red shirt-sleeves looked for once in
keeping with the scene, arising as they did out of yellow flame-tinged
clouds from the rubbish-heap which he was burning, and
the pleasant pungent smell of which filled her eyes with tears,
half smoke, half emotion. Even in that glow the homely hair-circled
face was capable of a new illumination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious goodness, there’s Jinny!” He ran to the house-door.
“Mother! Mother!” he cried in jubilant agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha emerged at a hobbling run, apron-girded. Despite the
glow, <span class='it'>her</span> face darkened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You give a body a turn,” she grumbled. “I almost thought
’twas the Golden City coming down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis nigh as good,” he retorted boldly, “bein’ as Jinny was
same as gone there. And bless me, ef she don’t look ghosty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Jinny!” said Martha coldly. “We don’t
need a carrier now—with our coach to get everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s cheeks turned far from “ghosty.” “I haven’t come
to you—only to Mr. Flippance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he gets everything, too, through Willie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that—I merely want to speak to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The missus means he’s abed,” Caleb explained, rushing to
Jinny’s relief, and indeed the information brought a smile back
to her twitching lips. “Minds me of a great old tortoise, diggin’
hisself into his blankets. Do him good to be up with the sun,
same as when Oi was a scarecrow, soon as the wheat was
sown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t want to tell everybody you began as a scarecrow,”
said Martha frigidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef we’re rich now, dear heart, and can ride in our own coach,
’tis the Lord’s hand, not ours. Oi watched over wheat and
winter beans, and ’arly peas, and winter oats, and then spring
barley, but all the time the Lord was watchin’ over me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not as a scarecrow,” said Martha severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi warn’t a scarecrow ploughin’-time, bein’ set on the
middle hoss to flick the whip, and chance times when ’twas too
frosty to plough Oi went to Dame Pippler’s to school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard that before,” said Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dedn’t like to tell ye,” he confessed, “being as ’twas too
cowld to howd the slate-pencil, and the book-larnin’ leaked out
’twixt the frosts. ’Twas a penny a week wasted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha saw their visitor was amused at this revelation after
fifty years of wedlock. “Jinny wants to be going on,” she
observed testily. “Look at all her boxes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’m proper pleased to see ’em, for as Oi says to Willie, Oi
hope as you ain’t hart Jinny’s business and grieved the Lord.
Ye can’t sleep, Oi says, ef ye’ve grieved the Lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Mr. Flippance must be a saint,” laughed Jinny. But
she was touched to tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb had, however, not finished his apologia for his lack of
learning, and was to be diverted neither by Jinny’s jests nor his
wife’s grimaces. “And in the summer,” he explained carefully,
“Oi got to goo out with my liddle old gun agin they
bird-thieves, though peas and pebbles was all the shot my
feyther——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you try some at Mr. Flippance’s window?” interrupted
Jinny, fearful the fretful Martha would soon close her
door upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’d have to stand sideways for that!” He pointed to a
hooked-back casement. “Fust he kivers hisself up, then he
opens hisself out”—he chuckled contemptuously—“ ’tis ‘in
dock, out nettle,’ as the sayin’ goos.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny lifted her little horn to her lips and blew a blast so
literally rousing that hardly had its echoes died than from the
black casement framework a red unshaven face, like the rayed
rising sun on an inn signboard, dawned above clouds of flamboyant
dressing-gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny! Hurrah!” cried the apparition in delighted surprise.
“The very person I’ve been wanting for weeks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the effulgence of that great rubicund sphere of a face
Jinny’s mists began to dissolve—after all, with all his faults he
belonged to her rosy past, to the good old times ere black horses
or red men had arisen to rend her. “Then why didn’t you let
me know?” she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I was thinking of doing. So glad you’ve saved
me a letter. Never was so hard-worked in my life. Good
morning, ma,” he threw to Mrs. Flynt, whose set face now
relaxed into a maternal mildness, “do I smell breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye could ha’ smelt it afore seven, friend,” said Caleb, growing
dour as Martha grew soft. “And the missus a bit paltry to-day,
too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I late? I’m so sorry. Why, I thought it was Will’s
horn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Flippance overslept himself, dearie,” Martha said
reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you hate food spilin’,” Caleb protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much as <span class='it'>I</span> hate spoilt food!” said Tony. “Not that
a good housekeeper like Mrs. Flynt would really let food spoil—any
more than you your wheat-patch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef ye had helped gittin’ that bit o’ corn in,” retorted Caleb,
“ye’d fare to have more to sleep on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s more than one kind of work, Caleb,” said Martha
severely. “There’s brain-work for them that have never been
scarecrows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, Mrs. Flynt!” said Tony earnestly. “I’m
worked to a shadow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there was no such hurry to get the corn in,” Martha
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all they prayers for rine gooin’ on, ye can’t be too
careful,” Caleb urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what work had you got, Mr. Flippance?” Jinny laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Getting married. Didn’t you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was startled. “But you’re not married already?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No such luck. When the lady says ‘Yes,’ you think all
your troubles are over. But they’re only beginning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb’s face relaxed in a grin, whereupon Martha’s hardened
to a frown. “Marriage is no laughing matter,” she said, with a
glower at her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed, Mrs. Flynt!” endorsed Tony. “What with the
forms and questions and ceremonies and witnesses and what not,
and rings to buy and bouquets to order—it’s worse than a
dress rehearsal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ve had the rehearsal,” Jinny reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was young and strong. Now you’ve got to help me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Me?</span>” Jinny was enchanted at this smoothing of the path
for Miss Gentry. “But I’m so busy,” she protested professionally.
“I can’t wait till you’re up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny’s too busy,” Martha corroborated. And in her eagerness
to be rid of the girl, she unconsciously clucked to Methusalem,
and so exactly like Jinny that the noble animal actually
started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait! Wait!” Mr. Flippance shouted down wildly. “Do
wait! Such a lot to consult you about. Haven’t even got a
best man yet. Find me one and I’ll call down blessings on your
head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want you to call them <span class='it'>down</span>,” she jested up. “That’s
the trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be down before you can say ‘Jack Robinson.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t going to suggest <span class='it'>him</span>!” And she reined in her
fiery steed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha had hurried to her kitchen to bring in the belated
breakfast, and the convulsion into which Jinny’s last remark
appeared to throw Caleb was left unchecked by wifely grimaces.
The veteran alternated between gurgles and roars so continuously
that Jinny, flattered as she was by the reception of her jest,
began to feel uneasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fair flabbergasted him,” he gasped, getting his breath
at last. “How can Oi, says Oi, ef Oi’m a buoy-oy, Oi says.”
He wiped the tears from his whiskered cheeks and blew his nose
into his great “muckinger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he didn’t ask <span class='it'>you</span> to be best man,” she said, puzzled.
“And you aren’t a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twas master as called me a buoy-oy,” he explained, his eyes
still dancing, “so as to keep down my wages. Oi’ve got three
hosses same as the min, Oi says, and can plough my stetch
similar-same as them and cut and trave up my corn better’n
Bill Ravens as felt the teeth of the sickle two days arter he
started and couldn’t work no more, though double-money time,
as Oi can sartify bein’ as ’twar me what tied my neckercher
round his arm with the blood pourin’ down like sweat, and
lucky ’twarn’t his wife, Oi says, but another woman gooin’
behind him to be larnt how, she bein’ in confinement. But
master he wouldn’t listen to nawthen. Oi’ll give you easy
ploughin’ was all he promised, ye’re onny a buoy-oy, he says,
obstinacious like, and Oi stayed on a bit, not mislikin’ the cans
of tea the wives brought, all hot and sweet, and the big granary
with pillars and fower on us thrashin’ and rattlin’ on the big
oak floor, jolly as a harvest supper, and Bill Ravens—that be
the feyther of the rollin’ stone as shears chance times for Master
Peartree—singin’ like the saints in Jerusalem, all except for
the words. But at last, bein’ as feyther wanted the money and
Oi needed time to look for a farmer not so nippy, gimme a
week off, says Oi to old Skindflint. A week off! says master.
What for? Gooin’ to git married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point the convulsion recommenced, and Jinny, though
she understood how the Flippance wedding had set his memories
agog, had still to wait for enlightenment as to why they were
agrin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Married, Oi says! How can Oi git married, ef Oi’m a
buoy-oy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was out at last, the great repartee of his life, and Jinny felt
he was right to cherish its memory. She occupied the period of
his renewed cachinnation in descending from her seat and giving
Methusalem his impoverished nosebag. Her action reminded
Caleb to offer to show her the enlarged stables, with the old roof
raised to admit the coach. Then, colouring as if at an indelicacy,
he hastily inquired how her grandfather was, remarking with
commiseration that he must be getting a bit elderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never had Jinny known him so loquacious—the absence of
Martha was combining with her own advent to loosen his
usually ruly member. And at last the pent-up flood of his
grievances against the Showman burst forth. The return of
Will, Jinny gathered, had been dislocating enough, even before
his new-fangled coach had brought the stir of the great world
and Bundock almost daily, but now the house and the hours
were all “topsy-tivvy,” worse than in Cousin Caroline’s time.
He would do Will the justice to say that it wasn’t his fault—Will
had been against putting up a “furriner” in their spare bedroom—but
the “great old sluggaby” had come and ingratiated
himself so with the rheumatic but romantic Martha, and offered
such startling prices—a pound a week for board and lodging—“enough
to feed the whole Pennymole family for a fortnight”—that
she had forced her will upon both the male Flynts. “The
trouble with Martha is,” Caleb summed up, “she allus wants
what she wants.” Mr. Flippance, he explained, “got a piper
for her from her Lunnon Sin Agog—funny name that for the
Lord’s House, even in Lunnon—and that piper fared to be all
about the Christy Dolphins and their doin’s—the <span class='it'>Loightstand</span>,
Martha called it. And she read me a piece out of it how Mr.
Somebody, husband o’ Sister T’other, was baptized by Elder
Somebody Else; and she wanted me to goo and do likewise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you <span class='it'>are</span> nearly one of them, aren’t you?” Jinny smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked uneasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi don’t want to be baptized a Jew,” he said plaintively.
“Martha she argufies as Paul says <span class='it'>we</span> are the Jews, bein’
Abraham’s seed in our innards. So long as she calls us the
Lord’s people, Oi fair itches to be one, but that goos agin the
stomach like to call yourself a Jew. Same as she was satisfied
with the New Jerusalem part, Oi’d goo with her. For ef the
Book says, ‘No man hath gone up to heaven,’ or ‘Whither Oi
goo, ye cannot come,’ that proves as heaven’s got to come to us,
and happen Oi’ll live to see it droppin’ down with its street of
pure gold same as transparent brass. But Oi won’t be swallowed
up whole like a billy-owl swallows a mouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that you’re saying, Caleb?” said Martha, now
perceived back at her house-door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was telling me about the <span class='it'>Lightstand</span>,” said Jinny glibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha beamed again. “Ah, it won’t be long before that
light spreads, though now the world is all shrouded in darkness
and superstition. But salvation is of the Jews.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t writ in the Book?” inquired Caleb anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Salvation is of the Jews,” repeated Martha implacably.
“John iv. 22. There’s nine of us now in Essex alone, the
<span class='it'>Lightstand</span> says, not reckoning London. They don’t know
about another that’s on the way Zionwards,” she added mysteriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning me?” said Caleb nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning a man with brains and book-learning,” said Martha
sternly, “and he’s ready to see you now, Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, nine ain’t no great shakes,” Caleb murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are the salt of the earth,” Martha reminded him. “A
pinch of salt goes a long way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, when it rolls in a pill-box,” Caleb reflected ruefully.
“And hows the old chapel, Jinny?” he said aloud. “Willy
never goos now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny coloured up: one of her pretexts for apostacy seemed
null and void.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see you when I come out, I suppose,” she said evasively,
as she followed Martha within.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The parlour of Frog Farm had not the peculiar mustiness
which greeted Jinny’s nostrils when last she peeped into it that
tragic morning of Maria’s illness, but there was by way of compensation
a reek of stale tobacco and the odours of the breakfast
bacon and mushrooms, while in lieu of the sacrosanct tidiness
there was a pervasion of papers, with a whole mass of scripts
sliding steadily from the slippery sofa. The brown-lozenged
text on the wall: “When He giveth quietness, who then can
make trouble?” seemed to shriek for Caleb’s answer: “Friend
Flippance.” Other documents bulged and bristled from both
pockets of the dressing-gown as from greasy paniers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, Jinny,” Tony gurgled from his breakfast-cup.
He eyed her rapturously. “What a pretty pair you’ll make at
the wedding!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no use, Mr. Flippance,” said Martha, beaming, “I’ve
told you before I won’t go into a church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flippance, who had been mentally coupling his bride and
Jinny, replied with but the briefest muscular quiver, that the
only thing that reconciled him to Martha’s absence was that she
was incapacitated by matrimony from the rôle of bridesmaid.
This morning he would not trouble her to wait. “You can
‘withdraw’ from me,” he said jocosely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha was jarred by this profane use of the sacred vocabulary,
and moreover felt it almost as improper to leave Jinny alone in
her house, even with a budding bridegroom. “Jinny’s got no
secrets from me,” she said tartly; and Mr. Flippance, divining
his error, remarked blandly, “Nor have I.” And as Martha
started to dust the mantelpiece ornaments and to discover cigar-ash
in her china shoes, he drew Jinny’s attention to the “beautiful”
silk sampler that hung over them. “And all worked with
Mrs. Flynt’s own hand! What a wonderful lion—and as for
the unicorn, she’s got it to the life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s only what I did when a girl,” said Martha, blushing
modestly. “Only I didn’t like to hang it up then, because I’d
left no room for the foreign trees like my sisters put in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but you’ve got in the alphabet, big and little, and all
the figures! Wonderful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where Willie learnt his A B C from,” said Martha,
radiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that gay deceiver!” sighed Mr. Flippance. “He told
me he was a Yankee, but now I find he’s only a yumorist. Still
he’s a chap any woman can be proud of—what do <span class='it'>you</span> say,
Jinny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny, who had seated herself on the sofa, carefully steadied
the slipping manuscripts as she replied with a forced lightness:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, if you want a best man, you can’t find a better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that’s the trouble. He won’t take part in a Church
ceremony neither, he says he’s got to consider the old folks—at
the chapel,” he added promptly. “But at any rate we shall
have the best bridesmaid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean me?” said Jinny, colouring under his
admiring gaze. “Because it’s impossible. I haven’t the time—or
the money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it the dress you’re thinking of? Surely the Theatre
Royal, Chipstone, can run to that?” And pulling a protrusive
scroll from a pocket of his dressing-gown, he unfurled it beatifically,
exposing a poster with the coupled names of Anthony
Flippance and Cleopatra Jones in giant letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anthony and Cleopatra!” he breathed in a ravishment.
“The moment she told me her second name was Cleopatra I
knew it was useless fighting against the fates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But have you bought our chapel then?” Jinny inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bought your chapel?” Mr. Flippance was mystified. “Why
on earth should I buy your chapel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you might have turned it into a theatre!” she stammered
apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waved the suggestion away with a jewelled hand. “Only
a new Temple of Thespis could live up to Anthony and Cleopatra.
We are building!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?” Now it was Jinny that was mystified—she had
seen no such enterprise afoot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here!” He tapped the other pocket of his dressing-gown.
“Plans!” He rolled up his poster reluctantly. “Cleopatra
wanted to see it in print. Didn’t I say what a work getting
married was? But now that the bridesmaid’s settled——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she’s not!” said Jinny, more alarmed than when he
was trying to cast her for the bride, perhaps because the danger
of being sucked in was greater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny!” He looked at her with large reproachful eyes
and mechanically threw bacon to Nip, who had at last sniffed
his way in, and who, fortunately for Martha’s composure, caught
it ere it reached her carpet. “You see she wants to have the
thing all regular and respectable, and all her family are in Wales.
She hasn’t got a parent handy to give her away. And having
led a wandering life, she hadn’t even a parish to marry in. I
never thought you’d desert an old pal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m no pal of hers—I don’t even know her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny!” And just arresting a paper-slide, he extricated
a photograph from the imperilled mass. “The new Scott Archer
process,” he declared proudly. “Knocks your daguerreotypes
into the middle of last week. Good gag that, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was Jinny who seemed knocked into that period; and
not only by this new triumph of the camera. For in this wonderful
breathing image she recognized—in all save size, for this
seemed a Cleopatra swelling to regal stature—the beauteous human
doll she had last seen walking down the steps of a toy house,
conning a part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she’s married!” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet. Would to heaven it <span class='it'>were</span> all over!” said Mr.
Flippance airily, but his great brow grew black for an instant ere
he turned it sunnily on Martha. “Oh, ma, <span class='it'>could</span> I have more of
these marvellous mushrooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see, you greedy boy,” she smiled, retreating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, who could help saying encore to such items?” He
turned reproachfully on Jinny. “You nearly shocked the old
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But didn’t you—didn’t you call her the Duchess?” Jinny
stammered. “Oh, but perhaps it is Mrs. Duke’s sister—she
looks taller.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s because she’s got no legs,” he explained paradoxically.
“But it’s all right—The Loveliest Leading Lady in London.”
(Jinny heard the capital letters distinctly.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on to explain that London didn’t know this yet, and
that some time must elapse before Cleopatra would be in a
position to demonstrate it on the spot, owing to local jealousies.
But Jinny came back remorselessly to her point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely she was married to Mr. Duke!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Appearances are deceptive. They were just close
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t well be closer—in that doll’s house,” said Jinny
scornfully. And her own words reminded her how he had
denounced the Duchess as a “squeaking doll” whose “golden”
hair was spurious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you shock <span class='it'>me</span>, Jinny,” said Mr. Flippance severely.
“Pure as the driven snow is my Cleo, stainless as the Lady
Agnes, shut up in that great oak chest on her wedding morn, sweet
as her namesake, Bianca, in <span class='it'>The Taming of the Shrew</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why does she tame shrews?” asked Jinny, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a play by Shakespeare”—the name not occurring
in the Spelling-Book, left Jinny unimpressed. “A shrew is a
vixen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This natural history left Jinny still less impressed. “That’s
nonsense,” she said. “A shrew is tiny and lovely to look at,
with darling rounded ears. I buried one the other day, and its
eye was as bright as life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only a way of speaking,” he explained, “as you call a
woman a cat. Katharina’s the polecat of the play that her
husband has to tame with a whip, but Bianca is a dove, gentle
and spotless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doves are not so gentle,” said Jinny. “They peck each
other dreadfully. I like vixens better, at least they seem fonder
of their family when you peep down their earths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flippance, who had never in his life seen either a shrew
or a vixen or a polecat or observed the habits of doves, was taken
aback. He had even a vague sense of blasphemy, some ancient
religious images whirring confusedly in his brain. “Understand
this, Jinny,” he said sharply, abandoning the shifting sands of
metaphor, “Cleo gave Mr. Duke her companionship and her
artistic co-operation, but as for marrying him—bring me that
Book!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He indicated the precious volume which Mrs. Flynt had left
in the parlour for his study of the text-evidence of the Christadelphian
teaching. But Jinny took his Bible oath for granted.
Sincerity and righteous indignation radiated from every round
inch of his face, and Jinny, despite her farmyard experience, was
too nebulous in her ideas of human matings not to be shaken.
In truth he had been vastly relieved by the discovery that the
couple had pretermitted the ceremony and that he was saved
the tedium and expense of a divorce suit, though he wondered
why Mr. Duke with his meticulous book-keeping and contracts
should be so loose where women were concerned, while he, so
averse from parchments and figures, had a proper respect for the
marriage-tie. Human nature was devilishly deep, he thought:
no wonder a man got drowned if he tried to fathom himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jinny, though she now believed she had misunderstood
the ducal <span class='it'>ménage</span>, was not without an instinctive distrust. “She
didn’t want to live in the caravan,” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he agreed, misapprehending the local idiom. “It was
that pig-headed wire-puller who wanted it. Duke’s the villain
of the piece, abusing my darling’s innocence and exploiting her
artistic aspirations. He got round the poor girl, knowing her
aunt had left her all her money. Cleo, my dear Jinny, is the
niece of the famous Cleopatra, the Cairo Contortionist, after
whom she was christened, and whose death a year or so ago
eclipsed the gaiety of Astley’s and Mr. Batty’s new Hippodrome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she so beautiful?” asked Jinny, somewhat awed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was in love with her myself in my youth,” Mr. Flippance
replied simply. “But though you could gossip with her round
the coke-brazier at the back of the ring, she always made you
feel that no man was worthy to chalk the soles of her tight-rope
shoes. And her niece, as you have doubtless perceived, has the
same grand manner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why did she keep company with Mr. Duke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny returned to the sore spot, Mr. Flippance felt, like a
buzzing bluebottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t believe me,” he cried, “show me the little
Dukes and Duchesses. Where are they? Produce ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her fiercely—as demanding a rain of coroneted
cherubs from the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bold stroke put the climax to Jinny’s obfuscation.
Marriage without children was practically unknown on her round,
though the children often died. “Don’t you see he wanted to
compromise her?” pursued Tony triumphantly, after giving the
cherubs a reasonable time to materialize. “He thought she’d
never dare break away with her money, and that he could spend
her last farthing on boosting himself into the legitimate. He’s
all right with the marionettes—a dapster as you say here,” Mr.
Flippance admitted magnanimously. “But as an actor he could
no more expect to please <span class='it'>my</span> public than to keep Cleo hidden in
a bushel. He might throw up the sponge and go back to his
<span class='it'>fantoccini</span>—but what career was that for Cleo? She broke with
him on the nail—the partnership, I mean. And I ask you, ma,”
he wound up, with an appreciative sniff as Martha re-entered,
not only with mushrooms but freshly fried bacon, “what woman
of spirit could do otherwise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Flynt beamed assent, and her apparent acquaintance with
the facts contributed to lull Jinny’s uneasiness. Surely the
pious Martha would not connive at scandalous proceedings.
Relieved, she sat silent; wondering—while Mr. Flippance did
jovial justice to the encore dish—what the Duchess would think
if she knew that she, Jinny, could have anticipated her in the
rôle of the second Mrs. Flippance. And what would Polly have
thought of her as a stepmother, she wondered still more whimsically.
Perhaps between them they could have made a man of
him. She had never seen his daughter over her cigar and milk
or her sense of Polly as a pillar of respectability might have been
shattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how is Miss Flippance?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face changed suddenly—rain-clouds overgloomed the sun.
His fork fell from his fingers. “You don’t know what daughters
are,” he blubbered. “She’s left me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Left you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask ma,” he half sobbed. It was infinitely pathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let it get cold again,” Martha coaxed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t eat.” He lit a cheroot abstractedly, and the old
woman and the young girl followed his silent puffings with a
yearning sympathy, while Nip begged, unheeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mad on marionettes is Polly,” he said at last. “The moment
I got rid of ’em, she packed up my things and was off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stole your things?” cried the startled Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no. She knew I should be moving on for the banns—Cleo
likes a quiet place—so she left me tidy. That was her sole
conception of her duty to her legal pa. But she had always
looked upon me as a thing to be tidied—not a soul to be loved
and cherished.” He wiped an eye with the sleeve of his dressing-gown
and asked brokenly for his brandy. Martha hurried to his
bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But perhaps your daughter’ll come back,” Jinny suggested
soothingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid!” he cried. “I mean they’d be at it hammer
and tongs. Perhaps Providence does all things for the best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where has she gone?” Jinny’s sympathy was now
passing to Polly, as she began to grasp the true complexity of
her exodus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To her grandmother in Cork, I expect.” He blew a placid
puff. “Did I never tell you my pa’s real wife—the one he didn’t
live with, I mean—was originally the widow of a well-to-do
cheesemonger? Polly always looked up her nominal granny
when we played Ireland. She likes respectable people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that why she won’t come to the wedding?” Jinny inquired
cruelly, for Polly’s refusal to countenance it again stirred up her
doubts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flippance was angered afresh. “I tell you, my Cleopatra
can hold up her head with the whitest cheesemonger’s widow in
the land. But it’s hard,” he said, reverting to pathos and
flicking his cigar-ash mournfully into the just-dusted shoe, “to
be left without a daughter at such a crisis. Think how she would
have stage-managed everything—even bought the ring.” The
tragedy of his situation mastered him. “Forgive my emotion—I
was always one to wear my heart on my sleeve.” He wiped
his eyes on it again. “Nobody will ever pack like Polly. Ah,
thank you, ma,” he said, as Martha reappeared with the brandy
bottle. “Have you half a crown?” he added, pouring himself
out a careless quota. “You see,” he explained, setting down
his glass dolefully, and tendering Martha’s half-crown to the
astonished Jinny, “though old pals desert one at the altar, Tony
Flip doesn’t forget his obligations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s it for?” Jinny took the coin tentatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You lent me it when that wicked Duke demanded money
on the contract.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you!” Jinny was touched—a half-crown seemed
as large as her cart-wheel nowadays. Half remorsefully she
suggested that a far better bridesmaid would be the girl at
Foxearth Farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “I’ve been into that. But there are—objections.
It doesn’t do, you see, for the super to be taller
than the leading lady. Now you being shorter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if Miss Jones were to wear very low heels——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that would only make Miss Purley look still taller,” he
said, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean Miss Purley to wear the low heels—<span class='it'>she</span> is a Miss Jones,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blanche Jones is her name—she’s only old Purley’s stepdaughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started up. “Then Mrs. Purley was formerly Mrs. Jones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah!” He seized the surprised Martha by the waist
and began waltzing with her, while Nip barked with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet, Nip! What’s the matter?” cried Jinny, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A relation at last! Don’t you see that Mrs. Jones can give
the bride away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she’s not really a relation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All these Joneses are one large family,” he said airily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t need a relation,” Martha pointed out. “A
friend will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really? I must study the stage-directions—I mean,” he
corrected himself hastily, “yours may be different from the
Church of England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I know all the same, for we weren’t allowed to marry in
our own chapels, leastways not till after Willie was born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyhow, I’m sure Cleopatra would prefer a relation.
Mrs. Jones is a Churchwoman, I hope. It’s necessary, ma, you
know,” he apologized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—her husband’s a churchwarden,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A churchwarden! Hurrah! Better and better. Then <span class='it'>he</span>
shall give Cleo away.” He bumped the beaming, breathless
Martha round again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he isn’t even called Jones,” Jinny reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A husband takes over his wife’s Jonesiness. Bless you,
Jinny!” He seized her hand and dragged her likewise into the
circular movement. “Now we go round the mulberry-bush, the
mulberry-bush, the mulberry-bush——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb, coming past the door at this instant, stood spellbound.
Had Mr. Flippance been really converted, and was it the joy of
the New Jerusalem? Or had Martha now “moved on,” and
was this the new dancing sect of which one heard rumours?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha’s caperings ceased at sight of him. “It’s the wedding,”
she said somewhat shamefacedly. “I’m just going to pickle
your walnuts, dear heart,” she added sweetly. “And Jinny
must be getting to her work, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At which delicate hint, Jinny, faintly flushing, rose to take
her leave, and Nip, who had been whining his impatience, was
already gambolling hysterically without, before she remembered
she had forgotten the very purpose of her visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, by the way, Mr. Flippance,” she said, as she followed Nip,
“I suppose the wedding-gown is ordered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wedding-gown!” he repeated. “You don’t think Cleo has
any need of wedding-gowns! Why the Lady Agnes dress—Act
One—is the very prop. for the occasion, and brand new, for
she had just got Duke to put on <span class='it'>The Mistletoe Bough</span>. Otherwise
I should have been asking you for the address of that wonderful
French friend of yours—the bearded lady, you know. But if
you won’t be a bridesmaid, you’ve got to come to the show—yes,
and the wedding breakfast too—I won’t take any refusal. It’ll
be at Foxearth Farm, and I’m ordering oceans of sweet champagne.
Well, thank you a million times for finding Cleo a
father. Good-bye, dear. God bless you!” He had shuffled
without and now kissed his hand to the moving cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about a new wedding-gown for <span class='it'>you</span>?” Jinny called
back. “A dressing-gown, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yumorist!” came his chuckled answer.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Though not unconscious of a subterranean hostility in Martha,
which she put down to the new business rivalry, and though still
perturbed about the Duchess, Jinny felt distinctly better for this
visit, not to mention the half-crown, that now rare coin. She
was still more heartened two days later when Bundock brought
a letter from Mr. Flippance stating that, strange to say, Cleopatra
did not find the Lady Agnes dress suitable. It would make her
feel she was only playing at marrying, she said, and she was too
respectful of holy matrimony to desecrate it by any suggestion
of unreality: indeed she was already being fitted by the leading
Chipstone artist. The dress was, however, turning out so
dubiously that she would be glad if Jinny’s French friend would
call upon her at Foxearth Farm with a view to preparing a
“double.” As for Jinny being bridesmaid, he must reluctantly
ask her to abandon the idea, as Cleopatra considered her too
short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the Flippance fist,” said Bundock, lingering to watch
her read the letter, “scrawls all over the shop. I don’t mind
your answering by post,” he added maliciously, “now I’ve got
to go there so much. I often kill—he, he, he!—two frogs with
one stone now. So you’re to be bridesmaid, Tony tells me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of the sort,” said Jinny, “and mind your own
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> my business,” he said in an aggrieved tone. “Didn’t
he ask me to be best man? As if in this age of reason I could
take part in superstitious rites!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see any superstition about marrying,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure—tying a man to a woman like a dog to a
barrel. But anyhow, why drag in heaven?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because marriages are made there, I suppose,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stuff and nonsense! And then the rice and the old shoes
they throw!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw <span class='it'>you</span> throw one when your sister got married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe. But I didn’t believe in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why did you throw it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated a moment. “They say if you don’t believe in
it, it’s even luckier than if you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny laughed heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not joking!” Bundock declared angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were, I shouldn’t be laughing,” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh well, <span class='it'>go</span> to church!” Bundock retorted in disgust. “And
I hope the beadle will give you an extra prod next Sunday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t pretend. Everybody knows that church is a double
torture—first the parson sends you to sleep with his sermon, and
then the verger wakes you up with his rod.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell me!” said Bundock. “My own father was forced
to go—all the labourers on the estate, poor chaps, dead-sleepy
after the week’s work, and that rod used to puggle ’em about. No
wonder dad chucked both squire and parson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t happen in Mr. Fallow’s church,” Jinny assured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because nobody goes!” And Bundock hurried off with
this great last word, and Jinny saw his bag heaving with the
mirthful movement of his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhat to Jinny’s surprise, Miss Gentry from being Cleopatra’s
alternative dressmaker developed into her adorer, it
appearing that the lady displayed not only proportions most
pleasing to the technical eye—“just made for clothes,” Miss
Gentry put it—but a positive appetite for tracts. She loathed
Dissent, it transpired, and to be married by a minister would
seem to her little better than living in sin. A very paragon of
propriety and an elegant pillar of the faith, Miss Cleopatra
Jones, spinster, worshipped regularly with the churchwarden and
his family in the wrong parish church. Miss Gentry, ravished
by this combination of respectability and romance, did not once
compel the fair client to attend upon her, travelling to Foxearth
Farm instead in Jinny’s cart. It was impossible for Jinny’s
doubts of Cleopatra’s immaculacy to survive Miss Gentry’s
encomiums. While Miss Gentry ascended to the bedroom of her
beautiful and still golden-haired client, posed in an atmosphere
of old oak bedsteads and panelled linen presses, Jinny would sit
with the second Mrs. Purley in her dairy—a cheerful, speckless
room which enjoyed a specially spacious window, dairies being
immune from the window-tax—while that bulkier edition of
Blanche made cheeses and conversation. Mrs. Purley made conversation
irrespective of her auditor, for she needed no collaborator:
indeed a second party coming athwart this Niagara of
monologue would have been swept aside like a straw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a great musician can take a few simple notes, and out of this
theme evoke endless intricacies, enlargements, repetitions, echoes,
duplications, parallelisms, and permutations, and then transform
the whole into another key and give it you all over again, so out
of a simple happening, like her feeding of a sick chicken, or her
discovery that a hen had laid her clutch in the hedge, Mrs.
Purley, without for a moment interrupting the milling of curd
or the draining of whey, could improvise a fugal discourse that
went ramifying and returning upon itself <span class='it'>ad infinitum</span>. It
reminded Jinny of Kelcott Wood, where every day from three
to five, on these September afternoons, hundreds of starlings,
perched like bits of black coal on the mountain-ashes, kept up
a ceaseless chattering, shrilling, clucking, querying, cackling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she soon ceased to hear Mrs. Purley, was even lulled by the
cascade. Very familiar grew every pan, dipper, vat, tub, press,
cheese-cloth, or straw-mat, while the one readable article she
knew by heart. It was the inscription on a china mug, in which
Mrs. Purley sometimes put milk, and it recorded the virtues of
a black-haired, black-whiskered head painted thereon. “The
Incorruptible Patriot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Undaunted Supporter of the
People’s Rights.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Father of the Fatherless.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
Pride and Glory of his Country” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. such were a few of the
attributes ascribed, with a profuseness resembling Mrs. Purley’s
conversation, to a certain Henry Brougham, Esq., who, as Jinny
learnt from Miss Gentry, was really and truly “a love,” having
defended Queen Caroline when Miss Gentry was a schoolgirl.
Queens were as liable to ill-luck as herself, Jinny began to suspect,
recalling that Egyptian asp, and she became a little anxious for
Victoria, who now came to figure in her dreams, as defended
against French fire-eaters by this black-avised man, with the
protruding nose, retreating forehead, and weak chin. Somehow—it
was unintelligible when she woke up, but quite clear in her
dream—the defended Victoria was also herself, for was not
Henry Brougham “The Father of the Fatherless”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adjoining the dairy was a room, lit from it—to avoid taxation—by
a pane in the door. Jinny sometimes had an uneasy sense
that Blanche was inspecting her through that pane. Otherwise
she hardly ever encountered the vespacide, who betrayed indeed
no sense of rivalry, for the relations between Will and the little
Carrier were unknown, and Blanche would, in any case, have
considered so humble a personage negligible or at least nippable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For if this handsome creature was—as she had struck Jinny-a
shade overripe, it was not for lack of volunteer pluckers, and
the mutability which Mr. Giles Purley had gently derided in his
son had been even more marked in his stepdaughter. Fortunately
Will was unaware of the episodes that had preceded his return
to England. And not only did he regard himself as the first
male that had ever squeezed that fair hand, but, untaught by
its prowess as a wasp-killer, he believed her a passive victim to
his own compelling charm. And the apparent perfection of
Blanche’s surrender was the more grateful to him after the
granite he had kept striking in Jinny. But the mobility which
had hitherto marked Miss Blanche’s affections was now manifesting
itself in a novel shape, for like Miss Gentry, she had come
under the spell of Cleopatra, though a very different Cleopatra
from the ardent Churchwoman who revealed herself to the dressmaker.
The Cleopatra who magnetized the cheese-maker’s
daughter, and who, carelessly abetted by Mr. Flippance’s sketchy
promises, filled the ignorant girl with dramatic and palpitating
ambitions, was a queen of the footlights, an inspirer of romantic
passions, and in her unguarded moments—as when you sat on
her bed at midnight with your hair down—a teller of strange
Bohemian stories, a citer of perturbing Sapphic songs, the
melodies of which she could even whistle. What wonder if Mrs.
Hemans—Blanche’s favourite poet hitherto—began to pall! She
had been proud enough of her culture, leaving, as she felt it did,
the parental perspectives far behind her; but now boundless
horizons seemed opening up before her, and the <span class='it'>London Journal</span>
which Cleopatra swallowed with her meals seemed to Blanche to
contain nothing so alluring as Cleopatra’s own career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was by quite accidentally overhearing a remark of Blanche’s,
and not by dint of Mr. Flippance’s repeated invitation, that
Jinny was finally strung up to attend the great wedding. The
probability that Will and Blanche would be at the feast was a
drawback that prevailed over the lure of a good square meal,
and even over the glamour of that mysterious nectar—champagne.
But when she heard Blanche instruct her mother that
she would certainly not have to lay a place for “that common
carrier,” in a flame that might almost have consumed her letter-paper,
Jinny wrote her acceptance to Mr. Flippance, and expended
his half-crown, which she had laid by for a rainy day, on a
wedding present which would do him good—a Bible, to wit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In prevision of the great day she left off wearing her best
gown, cleaned it, and by the aid of Miss Gentry and a bit of lace
gave it a new turn. After the wedding it must, alas, be pawned!
Jinny, though she had hitherto entered the pawnshop only to
pledge or redeem things for her customers, had schooled herself
to the inevitable. So had Mr. Flippance, whose idea of a best
man had now sunk to Barnaby. But he was used to handling
unpromising performers, he said, though he regretted the absence
of a dress rehearsal, more especially for Mrs. Purley, who, having
been induced to mother Cleopatra (nothing would induce Mr.
Purley to father her), was unlikely, he feared, to confine herself
to a simple “I do.” That was not, he groaned drolly, her
idea of a speaking part. He deplored, too, that there were not
enough bells or bell-ringers in the Little Bradmarsh church to
ring an elaborate joy-peal, as Cleopatra was so anxious to have
every property and accessory of holy matrimony complete. It
was for this reason, doubtless, that Miss Gentry, after reducing
the rival dress to a rag, ultimately emerged as the bridesmaid.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>For the convenience of Foxearth Farm, as well as of Will, who,
though a bit sulky about his mother’s waiting on the Showman,
was too entangled with Miss Purley to refuse to grace the festal
board, the ceremony had been fixed for a Saturday at ten, and
on that morning Jinny had meant to rise with the sun, so as to
do the bulk of her day’s chares in advance. What was her
dismay, therefore, to open blinking eyes on her grandfather
standing over her pseudo-bed in his best Sunday smock, whip in
hand, and to hear through her wide-flung casement Methusalem
neighing outside and the cart creaking!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I late?” she gasped, sitting up. Then she became
aware of a beautiful blue moonlight filling the room with glory,
and of a lambent loveliness spreading right up to the stars
sprinkled over her slit of sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis your wedding-day, dearie,” said the ghostly figure of the
Gaffer, and she now perceived there were wedding favours on his
whip, evidently taken from Methusalem’s May Day ribbons,
which he must have hunted out of the “glory-hole” where odds
and ends were kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bitterly she regretted having excited his brain by informing
him of her programme. He was evidently prepared to drive her
to the ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s too early,” she temporized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’ve got to be there for breakfus, you said, dearie,” he
reminded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” she explained. “The wedding breakfast with
fashionable folk is only a sort of bever or elevener at earliest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He chuckled. “Ye’re gooin’ to be rich and fashionable—won’t
it wex that jackanips! Oi suspicioned ’twas you he war
arter the fust time he come gawmin’ to the stable. Ye can’t
deceive Daniel Quarles. On your hands and knees, ye pirate
thief!” He cracked his whip fiercely. “Up ye git, Jinny,
ye’ve got to titivate yerself. Oi’ve put the water in your
basin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Gran’fer,” she said, acutely distressed, “it’s not <span class='it'>my</span>
wedding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not your wedding!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then whose wedding be it?” he demanded angrily. “ ’Tain’t
mine, seein’ as Oi’m too poor to keep Annie though she’s riddy of
her rascal at last.” He seized her wrists and shook her. “Why
did you lie to me and make a fool o’ me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So this was why Gran’fer had embraced her so effusively last
night when she avowed her programme for the morrow; this
was why he had given her blessings in lieu of the expected
reproaches for her projected absence; this was why he had gone
up to bed humming his long-silent song: “Oi’m seventeen come
Sunday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a mistake, she felt now, to have stayed at home for his
sake on the Friday, changing the immemorial day of absence.
He had been strange all day, without grasping what was the cause
of his unrest, and Nip’s parallel uneasiness had reacted upon
him. It was not, however, till she had incautiously remarked
that Methusalem too was off his feed, that he cried out in horror
that she had forgotten to go on her rounds. Smilingly she
assured him she had not forgotten: indeed the void in her whole
being occasioned by the loss of Mother Gander’s gratis meal had
been a gnawing reminder since midday. But imagining—and
not indeed untruly—that her work was gone, he had burst into
imprecations on “the pirate thief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she sat up now on her mattress, helpless in her grief, her
mind raced feverishly through the episode, recalling every word
of the dialogue, unravelling his senile misapprehension; half
wilful it seemed to her now, in his eagerness to clutch at happier
times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nothing to do with the coach competition, Gran’fer. It’s
only because I’ve got to be out to-morrow for a wedding!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wedding! She ain’t marrying agen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annie? Which Annie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s onny one Annie. ’Lijah’s mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Mrs. Skindle! What an idea! It’s a friend of mine, a
gentleman you’ve never seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point she had had, she remembered, the fatal idea of
showing him her furbished-up frock to soothe him, for he was
trembling all over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like to see what I’m going to wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She understood now the new light that had shot into his eye
as he touched the lace trimming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Similar-same to what your Great-Aunt Susannah wore the
day she married that doddy little Dap! Ye ain’t a-gooin’ to
make a fool o’ yerself similar-same. Who’s the man?” he had
demanded fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know him, I told you—it’s a Mr. Flippance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A beautiful peace had come over the convulsed face. “Flippance!
Ain’t that the gent what’s come to live in Frog Farm?
That’s a fust-class toff, no mistake. Uncle Lilliwhyte should be
tellin’ me, when he come with the watercress on Tuesday, as
Mr. Flippance pays a pound a week for hisself alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the point at which her grandfather had kissed her
with effusion, crying: “Ye’ll be in clover, dearie!” while she,
licking her chaps at the thought of the morrow’s banquet, had
playfully answered that there would certainly be “a mort to
eat.” The prospect set him clucking gleefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spite o’ that rapscallion!” he had chuckled, enlarging thereupon
to her on the way the Lord protects His righteous subjects,
and enlivening his discourse with adjurations to “the pirate
thief” to take to his hands and knees. Had followed reproaches
for hiding the news from him, reproaches to Mr. Flippance for
not calling on him, not even inviting him to the wedding: soothing
explanations from her that Mr. Flippance knew he was too
poorly to go that far; assurances she would be back as early as
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ought to have understood his delusion or self-delusion, she
thought, when he had clung to her in a sudden panic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then ye will come back—ye ain’t leavin’ me to starve! Ye
won’t let that jackanips starve me out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she had reassured him, and caressed him, even
promised to bring him something tasty from the wedding breakfast,
he had gripped her harder than ever—she could still feel
his bony fingers on her wrist—but of course they actually were
on her wrists as she sat there now against her pillow—“ye’ll live
here with me—same as afore!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why ever shouldn’t I?” she had answered in her innocence.
“We’ll always live with you—Methusalem, Nip, all of us.”
What unlucky impulse of affection or reassurance had made her
stoop down to kiss the dog in his basket—all her being burnt
with shame at the remembrance of her grandfather’s reply,
though at the time it had touched her to tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless ye, Jinny. Oi know this ain’t a proper bedroom
for you, but Oi’ll sleep here if you like, and do you and he move
up to mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had put by the offer gently. “Nonsense, Gran’fer. You
can’t shift at your age—or Nip either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi bain’t so old as Sidrach,” he had retorted, not without
resentment, “and Oi doubt he ain’t left off bein’ a rollin’ stone.
And Oi reckon Oi can fit into that chest of drawers better than
when Oi was bonkka.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the shrivelled form, with the hollow cheeks, flaming eyes,
and snowy beard, was still shaking her angrily, and her sense of
his pathos vanished in a sick fear, not so much for herself, though
his fingers seemed formidably sinister, as for his aged brain
under this disappointment. “Why did you say ’twas your
wedding morn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dutch clock, providentially striking three, offered a fresh
chance of temporizing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Gran’fer! Can’t be my wedding morn yet, only three
o’clock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He let go her hands. “Ain’t ye ashamed to have fun with
your Gran’fer?” he asked, vastly relieved. “But it’s a middlin’
long drive to Chipstone before breakfus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not at Chipstone—the wedding’s at Little Bradmarsh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” he said blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So there’s lots of time, Gran’fer, and you can go back to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not me! Do, Oi mightn’t wake in time agen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wake you—but I’ll be fit for nothing in the morning, if
I don’t go to sleep now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day Oi was married,” he chuckled, “Oi never offered to
sleep the noight afore—ne yet the noight arter! He, he!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away, Gran’fer!” she begged frantically. “Let me go
to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, goo to sleep, my little mavis. Nobody shan’t
touch ye. What a pity we ate up that wedding-cake! But Oi
had to cut a shiver to stop his boggin’ and crakin’, hadn’t Oi,
dearie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite right. Better eat wedding-cake than humble-pie!”
she jested desperately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef he comes sniffin’ around arter you’re married, Oi’ll snap
him in two like this whip!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t break my whip!” She clutched at the beribboned
butt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my whip, Jinny! Let that go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, go to bed then!” With a happy thought, she lit
the tallow candle on her bedside chair and tendered it to him. It
operated as mechanically upon his instinctive habits as she had
hoped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, dearie,” he said, and very soon she heard him
undressing as usual, and his snore came with welcome rapidity.
Then she sprang out of bed, pulled on some clothes, and ran out
to release the angry and mystified Methusalem from the shafts
and to receive his nuzzled forgiveness in the stable. But when
she got back to bed, sleep long refused to come; the sense of her
tragic situation was overwhelming. Even the great peace of the
moonlit night could not soak into her. It was impossible to go
to the wedding now, she felt. When at last sleep came, she was
again incomprehensibly Queen Victoria hemmed in by foes, and
protected only by “The Father of the Fatherless” with his
black whiskers. She awoke about dawn, unrefreshed and
hungry, but a cold sponging from the basin her grandfather had
prepared enabled her to cope with the labours of the day. She
looked forward with apprehension to the scene with the old man
when he should realize that the grand match was indeed off, but
she could think of nothing better than going about in her dirtiest
apron to keep his mind off the subject. The precaution proved
unnecessary. He slept so late and so heavily—as if a weight
was off his mind—that when he at last awoke he seemed to have
slept the delusion off, as though it were something too recent to
remain in his memory. As for the scene in the small hours, that
had apparently left no impress at all upon his brain. In fact, so
jocose and natural was he at breakfast, which she purposely
made prodigal for him, that the optimism of the morning sun,
which came streaming in, almost banished her own memory of
it too: it seemed as much a nightmare as her desperate struggle
against the foes of Victoria-Jinny. The lure of the wedding
jaunt revived, and the thought of the domestic economy she
would be achieving thereby, made her sparing of her own breakfast.
She had a bad moment, however, when her grandfather
suddenly caught sight of the horseless cart outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop thief!” he cried, jumping up agitatedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was vexed with herself. To have left that reminder of
the grotesque episode!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s that ’Lijah!” he shrieked. “He’s stole Methusalem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, Gran’fer!” she warned him. “Suppose anybody
heard you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he ran out towards the Common and she after him. His
tottering limbs seemed galvanized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My horse is all right,” she gasped, catching him up in a few
rods. “I was too tired yesterday to put my cart away, that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and glared suspiciously at her. “That’s <span class='it'>my</span> hoss—and
my cart, too! Can’t you read the name—‘Daniel Quarles,
Carrier.’ But ye won’t never let me put no padlock on my
stable!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your horse is there safe—come and see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He allowed himself to be led to the soothing spectacle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Oi’ll put a padlock at once, same as in my barn,” he
said firmly. “Don’t, that rascal ’Lijah will grab him without
tippin’ a farden!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The overlooked cart proved a blessing, not a calamity, for the
operation of padlocking the stable-door before the horse was
stolen so absorbed the Gaffer that Jinny found it possible, after
all, to don her finery and slip off to the wedding unseen even of
Nip, who was supervising the new measures for Methusalem’s
safety. Curiosity to see Miss Gentry’s creation in action had
combined with the pangs of appetite and her acceptance of the
invitation to make temptation irresistible, and she calculated
that she could be back by noon, and that, pottering over his
vegetable patch or his Bible, the old man would scarcely notice
her absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she reached the church, she found the coach stationed
outside, and though the liveried guard was lacking to-day, the
black horses looked handsomer than ever with their red wedding-favours,
while the pea-green polish of the vehicle reduced her to
a worm-like humility at the thought of the impossibility of her
cart taking part in to-day’s display. Evidently Will had brought
the bridegroom from Frog Farm. Out of the corner of her eye
she espied Will himself, sunning himself on his box, and her
heart thumped, though all she was conscious of was the insolent
incongruity of his pipe with the occasion, the edifice, his new
frock-coat, and the posy in its buttonhole. Fearing she was late,
she hurried into the church. But nothing was going on, though
the size of the congregation—far larger than usual—was an
exciting surprise. There was no sign of any of the wedding-party,
not even Mr. Flippance, and after imperceptibly saluting
her Angel-Mother, she sank back into a rear pew, half pleased to
have missed nothing, half uneasy lest there be a delay. Turning
over a Prayer Book in search of the Wedding Service, she
came for the first time, and not without surprise, on the Fifth
of November Thanksgiving “for the happy deliverance of
King <span class='it'>James I</span> and the Three Estates of <span class='it'>England</span> from the most
traitorous and bloody-intended massacre by Gunpowder: And also
for the happy Arrival of King <span class='it'>William</span> on this Day, for the Deliverance
of our Church and Nation.” King William’s arrival struck
her as providential but confusing—for though he had apparently
detected the Popish barrels in the nick of time, how came there to
be two kings at once? Suddenly she was aware, by some tingling
telegraphy, that the bride and bridesmaid had arrived outside
in a grand open carriage. Mr. Fallow in his surplice came in at
the clerk’s intimation and took up his position at the altar rails,
the musicians struck up “The Voice that Breathed o’er Eden,”
and then there was a sudden faltering, and a whispering took
place ’twixt parson and clerk, and Mr. Fallow was swallowed
again by his vestry, while the clerk disappeared through the
church door. It was realized that Mr. Flippance was not in the
church, and it was understood that the bride’s face was being
saved in the vestry, where, however, as time passed, the agitated
congregation divined hysterics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny—thinking of her neglected grandfather—was what he
called “on canterhooks.” Had Mr. Flippance not then come in
the coach, had he been carelessly left in bed as usual? Catching
her Angel-Mother’s eye, she received a distinct injunction to go
out in search of him, but she was too shy to move in the presence
of all those people, though she had a vision of herself frantically
harnessing Methusalem and carting the bridegroom to church in
his dressing-gown—would carpet slippers be an impediment to
matrimony, she wondered. Mr. Fallow came in again, looking so
worried that she recalled an ecclesiastical experience he had related
to her: how one of his parishioners, nowadays a notorious Hot
Gospeller, had “found religion” on the very verge of setting out
to be married, and had passed so much time on his knees, absorbed
in the newly felt truth, that it was only through his friend the
bell-ringer stopping the church clock that he was married by
noon; if indeed—a doubt which ever after weighed on Mr.
Fallow—he was legally married at all. What if at this solemn
moment of his life Mr. Flippance should similarly find religion!
She devoutly hoped the discovery would be at least
delayed till he was safely married. Good heavens! perhaps the
Bible she had given him was in fault! Perhaps she was responsible
for his rapt remissness. Disregarding the congregation’s
eyes, she went boldly into the vestry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, sure enough, she found the heroine of the day supported
by a trio of ladies. The outstanding absence of Mr. Flippance
left Jinny but a phantasmagoric sense of a bride, still composed
indeed, but so ghastly that despite her glamour of veil-folds and
orange-blossom she scarcely looked golden-haired; of a bridesmaid
hardly recognizable as Miss Gentry, for the opposite reason
that it was she with her swarthy splendour, opulent bosom, and
glory of silk and flowers who seemed the Cleopatra; of a Blanche
so appallingly queenly in her creamier fashion under the art of
the rival dressmaker, that her own cleaned gown seemed but to
emphasize her shabbiness and dowdiness. Acoustically the
voice of Mrs. Purley expatiating on the situation was the dominant
note, but through and beneath the cascade Jinny was aware of
Miss Gentry explaining to the bride that the horses which had
brought the bridegroom were not responsible for his disappearance.
Not unpropitious, but of the finest augury were these
sable animals, omens going by contraries. So they <span class='it'>had</span> brought
Mr. Flippance!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were tossing their bepranked heads, Jinny found, and
champing their bits, as if sharing in the human unrest. Will was
no longer smoking placidly on his box, but in agitated parley
with Barnaby and his father. She heard the inn suggested, and
saw the Purleys posting towards it. She herself ran round to
the tower, fantastically figuring Mr. Flippance on his knees on
the belfry floor amid the ropes and the cobwebs, but even the
one bell-ringer seemed to have sallied in search of the bridegroom,
or at least of the inn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The churchyard was large and rambling and thickly populated—pathetic
proof there had been life in the church once—and it
was in a sequestered corner behind a tall monument that Jinny
with a great upleap of the heart at last espied the object of her
quest, though he seemed even more unreal than Miss Gentry in
his narrow-brimmed top-hat, satin stock with horseshoe pin, and
swallowtail coat, while his face was as white as his waistcoat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing?” came involuntarily to her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reading the tombstones,” he said wistfully. “So peaceful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they’re waiting for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re waiting for everybody. That’s the joke of it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean the gravestones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! There’s a French inscription. And that name must
be Flemish, see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what have <span class='it'>you</span> got to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, <span class='it'>you</span> haven’t got time. It’s your wedding!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t rub it in! What long grass! So we go to grass—all
of us. Thanks for your Bible, by the way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So her apprehensions had been right. It <span class='it'>was</span> religion that was
bemusing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So glad you like it. Come along!” she said in rousing
accents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All flesh is grass,” he maundered on. “And rank grass at
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only thick here because they can’t mow this bit,”
she explained. “Too many tombs!” She plucked at his
sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it’s hay we run to!” he said, disregarding her “O
Lord! Mr. Fallow’s tithes, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, why waste good hay? He’s waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>he’s</span> got plenty of time by all accounts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, <span class='it'>she’s</span> waiting,” she cried, in distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she there already? Look at that bird cracking its snail
on the gravestone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an early bird—<span class='it'>you’ll</span> be late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry. Tony Flip never missed his cue yet. Funny,
isn’t it, how it all comes right at night—especially with Polly
there! Perhaps <span class='it'>she’ll</span> come, if we give her a little time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But have you invited her? Does she know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she don’t, it’s not for want of telegrams to every possible
address.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she may be in Cork, you said. You can’t keep the bride
waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She shouldn’t have come so early—it’s the first time I’ve
known her punctual. The early bird catches the snail, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s half-past ten! And there’s a crowd too—I don’t
know where they all come from. Come along!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One can’t consider the supers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, consider me then. I’ve got to get back to Gran’fer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The true artist always has stage-fright, Jinny. Give me a
moment. I’ll be on soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.” She was vastly relieved. “Have you got the
ring?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tony Flip never forgets a property. See!” And whisking
it suddenly out of his waistcoat pocket, he seized her left hand
and slipped it on her gloved wedding-finger. “That’s where it
ought to be, Jinny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pulled it off, outraged, and flung it from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On your wedding day, too!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now it’s lost,” he said cheerfully, “and the bearded bridesmaid
will have to go home with the unblushing bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have given it to Barnaby,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anxious and remorseful, she went on her knees, groping
feverishly in the long grass. “On your hands and knees” kept
sounding irrelevantly in her brain. Mr. Flippance watched her
like a neutral. “I’d forgotten that the woman runs away with
the piece,” he explained to her distracted ear. “I thought
marriage was a show with two principals. But if there’s got to
be a leading lady, why not stick to Polly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have thought of that before,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Correct as Polonius, Jinny. Even when I get the theatre,
it’ll only be hell over again. Why couldn’t I stick to the
marionettes? I charge thee fling away ambition, Jinny—by
that sin fell the angels. But you’ve only flung away my ring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it is!” She pounced joyfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just my luck!” He took it ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you said she was so pure and wonderful!” she
reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced. “That wouldn’t prevent her bullying me,” he
replied somewhat lamely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the taming of the shrew?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove! You’re right, Jinny! Petruchio’s the game!
Whips and scorpions, what?” His face took on a little of its
old colour. “It’s getting up so early that has upset me. After
all, Jinny, a lovely woman who loves you and puts all her money
on you isn’t to be picked up every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not. Anyhow it’s too late to change now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that! As if I didn’t want to change before there
was anything to change—oh, you know what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too late now!” she repeated firmly. She stood over
him, a stern-faced little monitor of duty. “Come along!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead—the rose-wreathed victim will be at the altar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved on a little. He paused as with sudden hopefulness.
“You don’t happen to know if there’s a great oak chest
with a spring lock in Foxearth Farm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I know?” she murmured, apprehensive now for
his reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sighed. “Well, never mind—it’ll all be all right at night.
And what’s it all for, anyhow? ‘Wife of the above,’ ” he read
out weirdly. “How they cling on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jinny had gone off into a reverie of her own. The tombstone
formula he had recited struck a long-buried memory, and
in a flash she saw again a quiet graveyard and a stone behind a
tumbledown tower, and Commander Dap’s black-gloved forefinger
tracing out her mother’s epitaph to a strange solemn little
girl. All the wonder and glamour of childhood was in that
flash, all the strangeness of life and time, and her eyes filled with
tears. When the mist cleared away, Mr. Flippance was gone.
She ran frantically around among the tombs like a sheep-dog till
at length the sound of Mr. Fallow’s ecclesiastical voice floated
out to her, and hurrying back into the church, she felt foolish
and tranquillized to find the service well forward.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny had misread Mr. Fallow’s look: it was not fear of
dragging on beyond the legal hour—noon was still too remote—but
impatience at being kept away from his antiquarian lore by
such trifles as matrimony, especially matrimony which was no
longer, as in pre-Reformation days, preceded by the Holy Communion
and symbolic of the union of Christ and His Church.
Had there been a care-cloth to be thrown over the couples’ heads,
such as existed in Essex churches in 1550, even matrimony might
have interested him. But as it was, his thoughts ran on old
cheeses. He had been comparing his Latin edition of Camden’s
“Britannia” (1590) with the two-volume folio translation, a
century later, by a worthy bishop, and was half scandalized, half
excited, to find that the translator had introduced a wealth of
new matter. Incidentally Mr. Fallow had learned the Hundred
was celebrated for its huge cheeses—<span class='it'>inusitatæ magnitudinis</span>—of
ewes’ milk, and that to make them the men milked the ewes like
women elsewhere. And these huge cheeses were consumed not
only in England, but exported—<span class='it'>ad saturandos agrestes et opifices</span>—“to
satisfie the coarse stomachs of husbandmen and labourers,”
as the bishop put it. When had this manufacture of giant
cheeses from ewes’ milk died out in Essex? Mr. Fallow had
already seized the opportunity of interrogating Mrs. Purley,
whose reputation as a cheesemaker had reached him. But
appalled by the voluminousness of her ignorance, he had taken
sanctuary in his church and was still brooding over the problem
as his lips framed the more trivial interrogatories of the ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Jinny, however, it was a thrilling moment when Mr. Fallow
lackadaisically called upon the couple “as ye will answer at the
dreadful Day of Judgment” to avow if they knew any impediment
to their lawful union. That in face of so formidable a
threat neither came out with “Mr. Duke,” though she still half
expected him to pop up in person from the void, was for her
sweet stupidity the final proof of the bride’s immaculacy. And
the whole service she thought beautiful and moving, having
missed the gross beginning thereof. She was startled to hear
the bridegroom addressed by Mr. Fallow as Anthony, and the
bride with equal familiarity as Bianca Cleopatra. Otherwise the
ceremonial seemed far too highflown for this terrestrial twain,
though somehow not at all transcending the relationship in
which her own soul could stand towards its spiritual comrade.
But the replies of the three principals came all in unexpected
wise. Mr. Flippance’s “I will” was so ready and ringing, and
his countenance so rosy, that Jinny wondered which was the
actor—the Flippance of the churchyard or the Flippance of the
church. The ex-Duchess, on the other hand, still pallid, faltered
her affirmation almost in a whisper, at any rate it was not so
loud as his comment: “I’ve told you always to speak sharp on
your cue.” Certainly no husband could ever have asserted
himself at an earlier moment—was he perhaps already following
Jinny’s hint, or was it only the stage-manager responding
mechanically to stimulus? As for Mrs. Purley, she showed even
more stage-fright, her “I do” failing even as a gesture, and
having to be prompted. “Too small a speaking part for her,”
commented Tony later, with a twinkle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When everything was over and the register signed and Barnaby,
breaking down under the weight of his financial duties, had wished
the bride many happy returns—a felicitation only dispelled by
his father saluting her as “Mrs. Flippance”—that now reassured
lady, sweeping regally to her carriage, her train over one arm
and her husband over the other—smiled at the admiring avenue
of villagers and small boys as though they had thrown her the
bouquet she held. When Mr. Flippance, gay and debonair, had
handed Mrs. Flippance, looking golden-haired again, into their
barouche, and been driven off with the hood up and his beautiful
doll beside him, Jinny perceived Will handing the gorgeously
gowned Blanche with parallel ceremoniousness into the coach,
where the transmogrified Miss Gentry was already installed
behind the bulwark of her great bouquet. And then Jinny became
aware of Barnaby hovering shyly between her and the trap
which held his parents, and indicating dumbly that the niche
vacated by his sister was now for her. She had a sudden feeling
that they did not want her in the coach beside those grand gowns
hunched out with starched petticoats. As if she would have set
foot in it! No, not for all the gowns in the world! But they
were right, she thought bitterly—what had she to do with all
this grandeur and happiness? The honeymoon was even to be
in Boulogne, she had gathered. And she heard some force,
welling up from the dark depths of herself, cry to Barnaby: “I
can’t come—I’m so sorry. But Gran’fer was upset in the night.
Please excuse me to Mr. Flippance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the bitterness passed from her soul to poor Barnaby’s.
Everybody was pairing off: the Flippances, his parents, Will
and his sister: there was nobody left for him but Miss Gentry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’ll be oysters as well as dumplings,” he pleaded.
“Will brought them from Colchester.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s famished interior—in making such a skimpy breakfast
it had counted on the wedding meal—seconded his plea desperately.
But the mention of Will was fatal. As a hermit’s sick
fantasy conjures up the temptation he knows he will resist, so
Jinny saw yearningly, vividly, but hopelessly, the spread banquet,
the dumplings soused in gravy, the brown bread and butter for
the oysters, the juicy meats, the mysterious champagne-bottles,
the sunny napery, the laughing festival faces, and, above all, the
curly aureole of Will’s hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” she repeated veraciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a panic the youth ran after the receding barouche. “Jinny
won’t come,” he gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t stop, coachman,” said Mrs. Flippance sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her,” called back Mr. Flippance, “she must—or I’ll
never ask her to my wedding again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Barnaby tore back to the coach. “I say, Miss Gentry,
you’re a friend of Jinny’s—do make her come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A friend of Jinny’s!” It was an even unluckier remark
than the reference to Will. A patron, an educator, an interpreter
of herbs and planets, gracious and kindly, who might even—in
private—admit the little Carrier to confidences and Pythian
inspirations, yes. But a friend? How came Mr. Flippance to
commit such a <span class='it'>faux pas</span> as to bring a carrier into equality with
her and Blanche? Why had not the adorable Cleopatra been
firmer with the man? “I can’t <span class='it'>order</span> her to come,” she reminded
Barnaby majestically. “It’s not like for a parcel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the horses tossed their wedding-favours and the coach
jingled off with its fashionable burden, even the trap moving on
under the stimulus of Mrs. Purley’s rhetoric, the whole scene
became a blur to Jinny, and standing there by the old pillion-steps,
she felt herself dwindled into a little aching heart alone in
a measureless misery. How tragic to be cut off from all this
gay eating and drinking! There was almost a voluptuousness
in the very poignancy of her self-mutilation. What a blessing
we all do run to hay, she brooded, in a warm flood of self-pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if Jinny thus saw the wedding-guests through a blur of
self-torturing bitterness, their feast did not begin as merrily as
she beheld it, despite that Mrs. Purley, as soon as she had
exchanged her bonnet-cap with the net quilting for a home cap,
served up unexpected glasses of gin. Anthony, no less than
Barnaby, was upset by Jinny’s absence, and Cleopatra resented
this fuss over a super. But still more disgruntled by the gap at
the table was, odd to say, Will. For his soul had not been so
placid as his pipe. The glimpses he had caught of Jinny were
perturbing. Overpowering as were the presences of the bride
and Blanche, or rather, precisely because they were overpowering,
they struck him as artificial by the side of this little wild rose
with her woodland flavour, and the memory of their afternoon
in the ash-grove came up glowing, touched as with the enchantment
of its bluebells. Blanche, for her part, was peevish at
Will’s taciturnity. Miss Gentry, still rankling under Barnaby’s
suspicion that she was the Carrier’s bosom friend, was particularly
down upon that youth’s naïve attempt to confine the conversation
to Jinny, though it confirmed her suspicion of the state of
things between those two. Mr. Purley in his turn had been
dismayed by Blanche’s fineries: the young generation forgot
that their fathers were only farmers compelled to take lodgers in
bad seasons. Thus it was left to Mrs. Purley to sustain almost
the whole burden of conversation. But her preoccupation with her
little serving-maid and the kitchen, plus her uneasiness at eating
in this grand room away from her hanging hams and onions,
interposed intervals of silence even in her prattle, and the theme
of her facetious variations—her fear in church that the bridegroom
had bolted—did not add to the general cheeriness. The
old wainscoted parlour, with its rough oak beams across the ceiling,
had seldom heard oysters swallowed with gloomier gulps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately the pop of the sweet champagne brought a
note of excited gaiety into the funereal air, and glass-clinking
and looking to one another and catching one another’s eye were
soon the order of the early-Victorian day. Mr. Flippance,
acknowledging the toast of the bride and bridegroom, did not
fail to thank Mr. and Mrs. Purley for the precious treasure they
had solemnly entrusted to his unworthy hands, a being whose
beauty equalled her brains, and whose virtue her genius. Mr.
Purley deprecatingly murmured “Don’t mention it,” meaning
of course his share in the production of this prodigy, but Mrs.
Purley, fresh from her church rôle, began to feel that she had
dandled Cleopatra in her arms. In replying for himself and his
“good wife”—for the age assumed that Mrs. Purley could not
speak—Mr. Purley could not wish the newly married couple
anything better than to be as happy as they had been. “Literally
‘a good wife,’ eh?” interlarded Tony genially. “None better,”
asseverated Mr. Purley. “I’m close, but she’s nippy.” “You’re
thinking of Blanche,” Barnaby called out gaily, through the
laughter. “I don’t say as your mother’s nippy in words,” Mr.
Purley corrected, with a twinkle. He went on to wish as much
happiness to all the unmarried people present, at which Miss
Gentry giggled and markedly avoided Barnaby’s eye; while
Will, reconciled to fate several glasses ago, squeezed Blanche’s
hand under the table. Even when Mr. Purley, becoming a little
broad, referred to the time when his “good wife” had first
ventured into “The Hurdle-Maker’s Arms,” Miss Gentry joined
in the hilarity. Her passion for the church-going Cleopatra had
convinced her that the stage was not necessarily of the devil—<span class='it'>The
Mistletoe Bough</span>, she had found, was only the same story
that had been written as a poem (“Ginevra”) by a Mr. Rogers,
who, she had gathered, was a most respectable banker, and she
was looking forward to her Mistress-ship of the Robes at the
coming Theatre Royal, and even to witnessing her darling’s
debut as Lady Agnes from the front. Several hysterical embraces
had already passed between her and the bride—somewhat
to Blanche’s jealousy—and all things swam before her in a rosy
mist as she now pulled a cracker with Mr. Purley and read
unblushingly:</p>

<p class='noindent'>a motto which caused the hurdle-maker to remark that it was
lucky his “good wife” had left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That loquacious lady had fallen strangely silent. The wine
which had loosened all the other tongues seemed to have constricted
hers. Perhaps it was merely the already mentioned
preoccupation with her pies or other dishes still in the oven. Or
perhaps it was the encounter for the first time in her life with
a great rival tongue. It consorted with this latter hypothesis
that she could be heard babbling now from her kitchen like a
cricket on the hearth, and her elaboration of a temperature
theme came distractingly across the larger horizons of Mr.
Flippance’s discourse, playing havoc with his account of
Macready’s Farewell at Drury Lane that March, and obscuring
the moral of the vacant succession. Charles Kean? Pooh!
Not a patch on his father. Had they seen him in Dion Boucicault’s
new play at the Princess’s, <span class='it'>Love in a Maze</span>? No? Then
before voting for Charles Kean he would advise them to go—or,
rather, not to go. He had never denied the merits of the manager
of Sadler’s Wells especially as Sir Pertinax Macsycophant,
though he knew his young friend Willie preferred Mr. Phelps in
<span class='it'>Othello</span>. “I say whom the mantle fits, let him wear it,” summed
up Mr. Flippance oracularly, and launched into an exposition
of how <span class='it'>he</span> would run “The National Theatre.” No Miss Mitford
tragedies for him with Macreadys at thirty pounds a week, still
less Charles Kean <span class='it'>Hamlets</span> at fifty pounds a night, but real plays
of the day—he did not mean the sort of things they did at the
Surrey, which were no truer to life than the repertory of the
marionettes, but why not, say, the Chartist movement and
the forbidden demonstration on Kennington Common? Or let
Mr. Sheridan Knowles, instead of talking his Baptist theology at
Exeter Hall, write a “No Popery” play, with Cardinal Wiseman
as the villain. (Hear, hear! from Miss Gentry.) Of course
there was the danger the censor would quash such plays as he
had quashed even Miss Mitford’s <span class='it'>Charles the First</span>, but then he,
Mr. Flippance, knew old John Kemble, and would undertake to
persuade him that times had changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Flippance, who had displayed some restiveness under the
long appraisal of male talent, displayed yet more when Mr.
Flippance was now provoked to rapturous boyish memories of
the censor’s sister, Mrs. Siddons. But Blanche and Barnaby
listened so spellbound that they ceased finally to hear their
mother’s inborne monologue at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this literally dramatic moment that Bundock
appeared at the banquet with the explanation that nobody
would answer his knocking, and tendered the bridegroom a pink
envelope which he had benevolently brought on from Frog Farm
on his homeward journey. Miss Gentry, unused to these bomb-shells,
uttered a shriek, which more than ever riveted the postman’s
eyes on her flamboyant efflorescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady! Steady!” said Tony, opening the telegram with
unfaltering fingers. “Take some more fizz. And give brother
Bundock a glass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He read the fateful message, and the anxious watchers saw
strange thoughts and feelings passing in lines across his forehead,
and in waves across the folds of his flabby clean-shaven jowl.
Then his emotions all coalesced and crashed into laughter, noisy,
but not devoid of grimness. “Listen to this!” he cried. “<span class='it'>‘Sincere
condolences. Married Polly this morning. Duke.’</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Flippance turned scarlet. “He’s married Polly!” she
shrieked. “The beast! The insulting beast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easy! Easy!” said the bridegroom to this second perturbed
female. “It isn’t him Polly’s married—it’s his marionettes.
Chingford, the telegram is marked. I expect the
caravan is honeymooning in Epping Forest. Give me Boulogne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nobody was listening to him any longer. The hysterics
that had been only a rumour in church became a reality now.
Miss Gentry had produced salts for her darling and was calling
for burnt feathers, and Blanche and Barnaby, tumbling over each
other kitchenwards, only set their mother’s tongue clacking
<span class='it'>fortissimo</span>. Even Mr. Purley was slapping the bride’s hands as
she shrieked on the sofa—he was deeply moved by her convulsions,
never having seen a doll in distress. Bundock alone
remained petrified, the empty champagne-glass in his hand, his
eyes still glued on Miss Gentry, and the bubbles in his veins
re-evoking that effervescence of the Spring in which even a rear-ward
consciousness of green mud had not availed to blunt the
charm of opulent beauty. Through the tohu-bohu Mr. Flippance
calmly scribbled a counter-telegram: “<span class='it'>Congratulations on your
marriage. Condolences to Polly.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pity we ain’t got some of that Scotch stuff to quiet her,” said
the agitated hurdle-maker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whisky, do you mean?” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! That new stuff they should be telling of—discovered
by that Scotch doctor—puts you to sleep, like, and onsenses you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, chloroform!” said Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, that’s the name. Masterous stuff for females to my
thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is, I understand.” Mr. Flippance smiled faintly. “But
not for cases like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The parsons won’t let you use it!” Bundock burst forth.
“They say it’s against religion. I suppose they want the
monopoly of sending you to sleep.” He sniggered happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I’ll</span> chloroform her,” Mr. Flippance murmured. He could
well understand Cleopatra’s fury at being replaced by a woman
so superficially unattractive as dear Polly, especially as she
herself, catching at any stage career in her impecunious days,
had not even been married by the fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you read my writing, Bundock?” he asked loudly,
proceeding to read to him in stentorian tones as if from the
telegram. “Polly, care of Duke’s Marionettes, Chingford.
Come home at once and all shall be forgotten and forgiven.
Your heart-broken——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Flippance was already on her feet and the telegram
in fragments on the floor. “I won’t have her here!” she cried.
“You’ve got to choose between us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling! Who could hesitate? Try a little gin.” He
hovered over her tenderly. “Take down a different reply, Bundock,
please.” He dictated the message he had really written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Condolences to Polly!” repeated Mrs. Flippance, smiling
savagely. “I should think so. I doubt if he has even legally
married her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, trust Polly for that! She’s got her head square on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Mrs. Flippance showed signs of relapse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Polly!” said Tony hastily. “Fancy her being tied to
a man like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that she could have done much better,” snorted
Mrs. Flippance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But fancy Polly being wasted on a man who packs for
himself! Another glass, Bundock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not while I’m on the Queen’s business, thank you,” said the
postman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re not. Aren’t your letters delivered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about your telegram?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, true. O Bundock, what a sense of duty! You recall
us to ours. We must drink to the Queen! The Queen, ladies
and gentlemen——” he filled up Bundock’s glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t refuse to drink that,” sniggered Bundock. “Wonderful
what one day’s round can bring forth!” he said, putting
down his glass. “I began with a baby—I mean the midwife
told me of one—went on to a corpse—and now here am I at a
wedding! It’s in a cottage by the holly-grove—the corpse, I
mean——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t want the skeleton at the feast,” interrupted Tony.
Bundock hastened to turn the conversation to the grand new
house Elijah Skindle was building—Rosemary Villa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche pouted her beautiful lips in disgust: “Don’t talk of
a knacker—that’s worse than a corpse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bundock was anxious to work off that Elijah called his
house “Rosemary Villa” because rosemary was good for the
hair, and having achieved this stroke, prudently departed before
the laughter died. Blanche seemed especially taken with his
gibe at that poor grotesque Mr. Skindle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After his departure, flown with stuff for scandal and witticism,
headier to him than the wine, the party grew jollier than ever.
They played Pope Joan with mother-o’-pearl counters and then
Blanche sang “Farewell to the Mountain,” by ear, like—a bird,
without preliminary fuss or instrumental accompaniment, and
Mr. Flippance crying “Encore!” and “Bis!” spoke significantly
of the possibility of including an annual opera season in English
in his Drury Lane repertory. Why should Her Majesty’s Theatre
and the Italian tongue have a monopoly? Ravished, Blanche
gave “The Lass that Loves a Sailor,” her eyes languishing, and
this led Mr. Purley on to dancing the old Essex hornpipe, whose
name sounded like his own, with Barnaby banging a tray for the
tambourine and Will’s throat replacing the melodeon. To Miss
Gentry, beaming in Christian goodwill upon the merry company,
it appeared strangely multiplied at moments. But the more the
merrier!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the happy pair had departed for Boulogne <span class='it'>via</span> the
Chipstone barouche, what wonder if Will, finding himself alone
in the passage with Blanche, and not denied a kiss, felt his last
hesitations deliciously dissolved. How restful to absorb this
clinging femininity, this surrendered sweetness! With what
almost open abandonment she had sung “The Lass that Loves
a Sailor” at him, with what breaking trills and adoring glances!
Marriage was in the air—two examples of it had been brought
to his ken in one morning—and he now plumply proposed a
third. A strange awakening awaited him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche grew suddenly rigid. Her imagination had already
been inflamed by Cleopatra, clinging to whose aromatic skirts
she saw herself soaring to a world of romance and mystery. She
had swallowed credulously the exuberant play of Mr. Flippance’s
fantasy round her feats of wasp-killing, and was willing to do
even that on the stage if it enabled her soles to touch the sacred
boards. In her daydreams Will had already begun to recede.
But now that Mr. Flippance had discovered a voice in her too,
and operatic vistas opened out under his champagne and his no
less gaseous compliments, she could not suddenly sink to the
comparative lowliness of a box-seat. That song which Will had
taken for the symbol of her submission was really the final
instrument of his humiliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rejected by the girl who has snuggled into one’s heart, evoked
one’s protective emotions, exhibited herself all softness and
sweetness! It was incredible! He did not know whether he
was more angry or more ashamed, and he was tortured by this
warm, creamy, scented loveliness which a moment before had
seemed under his palms to mould as he would, and was now
become baffling, polar, and remote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blanche! Blanche!” he cried, trying to retain her hand,
and tears actually rolled down his cheeks. But underneath all
the storm he heard a still small voice crying: “Jinny! Jinny!
Jinny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he had been saved from this fatuous marriage, from this
supple, conceited minx with her imitative scents and mock
graces. The genuine simple rosebud of a Jinny was waiting,
waiting for him all the time, the Jinny round whose heart his
own heart-strings had been twined from mysterious infancy, who
touched him like the song of “Home, Sweet Home,” heard when
miserable in Montreal, the darling lovable little Jinny as pretty
as she was merry, no real exemplar of the unmaidenly, only a
dutiful supporter of her grandfather and his business, at most a
bit unbalanced by her mannish role; Jinny the girl with the
brains to appreciate him, and whom he alone could appreciate
as she deserved! How wonderful were the ways of Providence!
How nearly he had been trapped and caged and robbed of her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see what you mean by leading a fellow on!” he
reproached Blanche hoarsely, with no feigned sense of grievance,
as he gazed at the mocking mirage of her loveliness. But underneath
the tears and the torment, his heart seemed to have come
to haven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny!” it sang happily. “Jinny! Jinny! Jinny!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On arriving home, Jinny’s first thought after giving the
Gaffer his dinner and swallowing a few mouthfuls to overcome
her faintness—her mood of self-torture would not allow more—was
to give Methusalem some oats extracted by stratagem from
the old man’s padlocked barn. She had scraped together a few
handfuls and was bearing them towards his manger in a limp
sack when she perceived that the stable-door was open and
gave on a littered emptiness. Her heart stood still as before the
supernatural. True, the new padlock was clawing laxly at its
staple as if forced open, but then it had not been there at all till
that very morning, and for Methusalem to leave his stable
voluntarily was as unthinkable as for a sheep to abandon a
clover-field. Yet there stretched the bare space, looking portentously
vast. What had happened? She ran round the little
estate, as though Methusalem would not have bulked on the
vision from almost any point, and then she peered anxiously
over the Common, as if he could be concealed among the gorse
or the blackberry-bushes. The hard ground of the road, marked
only by the dried-up ruts of her own wheels, gave no indication
of his hoofs. It flashed upon her that padlocks were after all
not so ridiculous, but examining more closely the one that
drooped by the stable-door, she saw that its little key was still
in it. Evidently the old man had forgotten to turn it. The
cart was still in its shed, looking as dead to her now as a shell
without its snail, though the image was perhaps a little too hard
on Methusalem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to alarm her grandfather before she had made a thorough
search would only confirm him in his delusions. Peeping through
the casement of the living-room, she was relieved to see and hear
him at the table, safely asleep on his after-dinner Bible. With
his beard thus buried in the text, he might sleep for hours in the
warmth and buzzing silence. Lucky, she thought, as she tip-toed
past, that he had not made the discovery himself. He
would probably have accused poor Mr. Skindle again, even set
out after the innocent vet. with his whip. Then perhaps actions
for assault and battery, for slander, for who knew what!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horse-stealing was unheard of in these parts, and who save a
dealer in antiquities would steal Methusalem? No; as in a fit
of midsummer madness—under the depression of the drought
and his depleted nosebags—he had bolted! After all, old horses
were probably as uncertain as old grandfathers. Was there to
be a new course of senility for her study, she wondered ruefully:
had she now to school herself to the vagaries of horsey decay as
she had schooled herself to human? But, of course, she surmised
suddenly, it was the dragging the poor horse up in the middle of
the night that had turned his aged brain, and the hammering-in
of the staple had lent the last touch of alarm. He had been
liable to panic even in his prime. Perhaps he had bolted before
Gran’fer’s very eyes, mane and tail madly erect. That might
explain the uneasy look with which the old man had met her
return—a sidelong glance almost like Nip’s squint after an
escapade—his taciturnity as of a culprit not daring to confess his
carelessness, as well as his welcome blindness to the wedding
fineries she had been too desperate to remove. But no, he
would not have sat down under such a loss, or brisked up so
swiftly under the smell of dinner, or pressed the food so solicitously
upon her with the remark, “There’s a plenty for both of us,
dearie—-do ye don’t be afeared.” It would almost seem as if he
had been noting her self-denial: at any rate such an assurance
could not coexist with the loss of their means of livelihood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a mystery. The only thing that was clear was that
Methusalem must be recaptured before her grandfather was
aware of his loss. Such a catastrophe, coming after the scene in
the small hours, might have as morbid an effect upon him as that
nocturnal episode had evidently had upon Methusalem himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bonnetless, with streaming ringlets, in her lace-adorned dress,
she wandered farther and farther in quest of her beloved companion.
It was some time before she discovered that her other
friend was at her heels. Surely Nip would guide her to Methusalem,
as he had guided her through the darkness. But this
abandonment to his whim only led her to the cottages with
which he was on terms of cupboard affection, and dragged her
into the very heart of the tragedy retailed by Bundock to the
wedding-party, to the home of a dead labourer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His fitten were dead since the morning,” the widow informed
her with lachrymose gusto. “At the end he was loight-headed
and talked about puttin’ up the stack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neighbours were still more ghoulishly garrulous, and the
odour of this death pervaded their cottages like the smell of the
straw steeped in their pails, and as the housewives turned their
plaiting-wheels they span rival tales of lurid deceases, while a
woman who was walking with her little girl—both plaiting hard
as they walked—removed the split straws from her mouth to
proclaim that she had prophesied a death in the house—having
seen the man’s bees swarm on his clothes-prop. She hoped they
would tell his bees of his decease. But desirable as it was to
meet a white horse—that bringer of luck—nobody had set eyes on
a wild-wandering Methusalem. Nor was he in the village pound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found herself drifting through the wood where she had
once sat with Will, and through the glade where the tops of the
aspens were a quiver of little white gleams. Had Methusalem
perhaps come trampling here? That was all her thought, save
for a shadowy rim of painful memory. Bare of Methusalem, the
wood at this anxious moment was as blank of poetry as the
lanky hornbeam “poles,” or the bundles of “tops” lying
around. One aspen was so weak and bent it recalled her grandfather,
and the white-barked birches craned so over the other
trees, she was reminded of a picture with giraffes in Mother
Gander’s sanctum. But of horses there was no sign. Picking
up a wing covert of a jay, not because of the beautiful blue
barring, but because it would make fishing flies for Uncle Lilliwhyte,
she now ran to his hut with a flickering hope that he
would have information, but it was empty of him, and she saw
from the absence of his old flintlock that he was sufficiently
recovered to be poaching. She emerged from the wood near
Miss Gentry’s cottage. But the landlady, who had the deserted
Squibs in her arms, could only calculate that Methusalem had
left his stable at the same moment as the dead labourer’s soul
had flown out of his body, and that there was doubtless a connexion.
“Harses has wunnerful sense,” said the good woman.
Jinny agreed, but withheld her opinion of humans. She felt if
only all the horses jogging along these sun-splashed arcades of
elms could speak, the mystery would soon be cleared up. For
Methusalem was of a nose-rubbing sociability. But it was only
the drivers of all these lazy-rolling carts—fodder, straw, timber,
dung, what not—that presumed to speak for their great hairy-legged
beasts. To one wagoner lying so high on his golden-hued
load that his eye seemed to sweep all Essex, she called up with
peculiar hope: he confessed he had been drowsing in the heat.
“So mungy,” he pleaded. Indeed the afternoon was getting
abnormally hot and stuffy, and Jinny had to defend her bare
head from the sun with her handkerchief. Hedgers and ditchers
had seen as little of a masterless, bare-flanked Methusalem as
the thatcher with his more advantageous view-point. Leisurely
driving in the stakes with his little club, this knee-padded,
corduroyed elder opined that it would be “tempesty.” And
they could do with some rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the rain was indeed wanted as badly as she wanted Methusalem
was obvious enough from the solitude about the white,
gibbet-shaped Silverlane pump and the black barrel on wheels
round which aproned, lank-bosomed women should have been
gossiping, jug or pail in hand. In the absence of this congregation
Jinny had to perambulate the green-and-white houses of
the great square and hurl individual inquiries across the wooden
door-boards that safeguarded the infants. Only the village
midwife had seen a horse like Methusalem as she returned from
a case. She had been too sleepy, though, to notice properly.
From this futile quest Jinny came out on the road again. But
wheelwright and blacksmith, ploughman and gipsy, publican and
tinker, all were drawn blank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside trees tidily bounding farms, or meadows dotted with
cows and foals, and every kind of horse except Methusalem, past
grotesque quaint-chimneyed houses half brick, half weather-board,
the road led Jinny on and on till it took her across the bridge.
Here on the bank she recognized the plastered hair of Mr. Charles
Mott, who was fishing gloomily. No, he had not seen a white
horse—worse luck!—and would to God, he added savagely, that
he had never seen a black sheep. Jinny hurried off, as from a
monster of profanity, for Mr. Mott’s disinclination for his wife’s
society, especially on chapel days, was, she knew, beginning to
perturb the “Peculiars”; and with the sacramental language
of the marriage service yet ringing in her ears, it seemed to our
guileless Jinny ineffably wicked to be sunk in selfish sport instead
of cherishing and comforting the woman to whom you had
consecrated yourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved on pensively—the road after descending rose somewhat,
so that Long Bradmarsh seemed to nestle behind her in a
hollow, a medley of thatch and slate, steeple and chimney-stacks,
hayricks and inn-signs, and fluttering sheets and petticoats. But
the forward view seemed far more bounded than usual, deprived
as it was of the driver’s vantage-point: to the toiling pedestrian
her familiar landscape was subtly changed, and this added to
the sense of change and disaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She passed Foxearth Farm near enough to see again the
barouche now awaiting the honeymooners, and to hear the
voices of Will and Blanche mingling in a merry chorus. There
was an aching at her heart, but everything now came dulled to
her as through an opiate. Methusalem was the only real thing
in life. She wanted to make her inquiry of the driver, but her
legs bore her onwards to a glade where she could rest on one of
Mr. Purley’s felled trunks. Even there the chorus pursued her,
spoiling the music of the little stream that babbled at her feet,
and the beauty of willow-herb and tall yellow leopard’s-bane and
those white bell-blossoms of convolvulus twining and twisting
high up among the trees still standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was well past five before, footsore and spent, she stopped
on her homeward road at the Pennymole cottage for information
and a glass of water. This must be her last point, for standing
as it did at the Four Wantz Way, it overlooked every direction
in which Methusalem could possibly have gone, had he come
thus far, while the size of the Pennymole family provided over
a score of eyes. She found herself plunged into the eve-of-Sabbath
ritual—all the seven younger children being scrubbed
in turn by the mother in a single tub of water, and left to run
about in a state of nature, or varying stages of leisurely redressing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But neither the nude nor the semi-decent nor Mrs. Pennymole
herself, with her bar of yellow soap, had seen even the tip of
Methusalem’s tail, and the extinction of this last hope left Jinny
so visibly overcome that the busy mother insisted on her sitting
down and waiting for tea. She urged that “father” would soon
be home, as well as the two elder boys, all at work in different
places, and “happen lucky” one of the three would have seen
the missing animal. Jinny felt too weak to refuse the tea, and
though the thought of her neglected grandfather was as gnawing
as her hunger, she reasoned with herself that she would really
get to him quicker if refreshed. The elder lads came in very
soon, one after the other, each handing his day’s sixpence to his
mother and receiving a penny for himself. But neither brought
even a crumb for Jinny. Mrs. Pennymole beguiled the time of
waiting for the master and the meal by relating, in view of the
labourer’s death, how she had lost two children five years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No fewer than four were down at once with the black thrush.
Two boys lay on the sofa, one at each end, an infant in the
bassinet under the table, and a girl in the bed. One of the
sofa patients had swellings behind his ears the size of eggs, but
they were lanced and he lived to earn his three shillings a week.
The other, a fine lad of thirteen, died at three in the afternoon.
The girl died at half-past eleven at night—beautiful she looked;
like a wax statue. The undertaker was afraid to put them in
their coffin; afraid to bring contagion to his own children.
“Perhaps your husband would do it,” he suggested to her.
But her husband, poor man, couldn’t. “How would you like
to put <span class='it'>your</span> childer in coffins?” he asked the undertaker.
The doctor wouldn’t let her follow the funeral, she was so
broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was Jinny who was broken now. These reminiscences
were more painful for her than for the mother who—inexhaustible
fountain of life—scoured her newer progeny to their accompaniment.
Yes, existence seemed very black to Jinny, sitting there
without food, or Will, or Methusalem, or anything but a grandfather;
and the china owl with a real coloured handkerchief tied
round its head, which was the outstanding ornament of the
mantelpiece, seemed in its grotesque gloom an apt symbol of
existence. She was very glad when cheery, brawny Mr. Pennymole
burst in, labouring with a story in which whisker-shaking
laughter bubbled through a humorous stupefaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had begun to tell the story almost before he had perceived
and greeted Jinny, and Methusalem’s disappearance, on which he
could throw no light, served to enhance it. To him, too, the day
had brought an earth-shaking novelty—there must be something
in the moon. For thirty years, he explained, as he took off his
coat and boots (though not his cap), he had risen at half-past
four. But waking that morning at one o’clock, he had got to
sleep again, and the next thing he knew—after what seemed to
him a little light slumber—was a child saying: “Mother, what’s
the time?” Half-past five, mother had replied—Mrs. Pennymole
here corroborated the statement at some length; adding
that it was Jemima who inquired, she being such a light sleeper,
and always so anxious to be off to school: an interruption that
her lord sustained impatiently, for this was the dramatic moment
of the story. Half-past five! Up he had jumped, never made
his fire nor his tea, never had his pipe, and instead of leaving
home at twenty to six, still smoking it, he had rushed round to
his brother-in-law’s, where fortunately he was in time for the
last cup o’ tea, and then out with his horses as usual!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And <span class='it'>I</span> made him tea and sent it round to the field,” gurgled
Mrs. Pennymole as she unhooked her bodice for the last baby.
“He had two teas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pennymole and Jinny joined in her laugh. “Sometimes
I’ve woke at ’arf-past three,” he explained carefully. “But <span class='it'>then</span>
I felt all right.” He recapitulated the wonder of his oversleeping
himself, as he drew up to the table, where the bulk of his progeny
was already installed, and it overbrooded his distribution of bread
and jam in great slices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And <span class='it'>I</span> was up at four!” Mrs. Pennymole bragged waggishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, upstairs!” Mr. Pennymole retorted, sharp as his knife,
and the table was in a roar, not to mention the four corners of the
room, where those of the brood squatted who could not find
places at the board. Everybody sat munching the ritual hunk,
though for the black strong tea the adults alone had cups, two
mugs circulating among the swarm of children, whose clamours
for their fair turn had to be checked by paternal cries for silence.
Mrs. Pennymole pressed both husband and guest to share her
little piece of fat pork fried with bread, but they knew better
what was due to a nursing mother. Jinny felt grateful enough for
the bread and jam and the tea, cheap but at least not from burnt
crusts, and sugared abundantly, despite that sugar—as Mrs. Pennymole
complained—had gone up “something cruel.” But though
such a meal was luxury for her nowadays, she could hardly help
wistful mouth-watering visions of the wedding-feast, from the
known dumplings to the unknown champagne. It was for a strange
company she had exchanged the wedding-party, she thought
ruefully, as she refused a third slice of bread. She could not well
accept it, when each child, solemnly asked in turn whether it
would like a second, had replied with wonderful unanimity in
the affirmative, and Mr. Pennymole, with his eye on the waning
loaf, had remarked that children had wonderful healthy appetites,
though that was better than doctors. She was glad,
however, to be given a wedge of bread and cheese, though when
her host jabbed his into his mouth at the point of his knife, it
called up a distressing memory of a gobbet of wedding-cake
thrown to a dog, and she became suddenly aware that Nip
was no longer with her. She remembered seeing him last as she
sat on the log, and she rightly divined that—wiser than she—he
had gone to the wedding-meal!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she could get away from her Barmecide banquet, the
brother-in-law and his wife came in, and then the whole story of
the oversleeping had to be laughed and marvelled over afresh.
The more often Mr. Pennymole told the story, the more his sense
of its whimsicalness and wonder grew upon him, and the more
his audience enjoyed it. “<span class='it'>I</span> made his tea,” cackled Mrs. Pennymole.
“I sent it round to the field. So he had two teas!”
The cottage rocked with laughter. Only the owl and Jinny
preserved their gravity. And even Jinny could not resist the
infection when Mrs. Pennymole boasted to her visitors that
she herself had been up at four, and Mr. Pennymole, with an
air of invincible shrewdness, pointed out that it was “upstairs”
she had been. So that though neither of the new-comers
could throw light upon the Methusalem mystery, Jinny left the
cottage refreshed by more than tea, and with the flavour of the
corpse-talk washed away. The humour of it all even went with
her on her long homeward tramp. In imagination she heard
the oddness of the oversleeping and the duplication of the teas
still savoured with grins and guffaws, while the little ones dribbled
bedwards, while the elder boys were scrubbed in the scullery, and
while the indefatigable Mrs. Pennymole was washing the hero
of the history down to his waist. Her fancy followed the tale
spreading over the parish, told and retold, borne by Bundock to
ever wider circles, adding to the gaiety of the Hundred, abiding
as a family tradition when that babe at Mrs. Pennymole’s breast
was a grandmother—the tale of how for thirty years Mr. Pennymole
had got up at half-past four, and how at long last the
record was broken!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speeding along in this merrier mood, Jinny had almost reached
home by a short cut through the woods, when she espied a gay-stringed,
battered beaver and learned the tragic truth.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Lilliwhyte was carrying by its long legs the spoil of his
rusty flintlock—Jinny was glad to see it was only a legitimate
curlew with its dagger-like bill. He offered the bird for sale, but
she was afraid it had fed too long on the marsh mud. She was
glad to hear, though, he had called that very morning and sold
her grandfather truffles—Uncle had a pig’s nose for truffles, and
her grandfather a passion for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He hadn’t got change for a foive-pun’ note,” Uncle Lilliwhyte
reported. “And Oi hadn’t, neither,” he chuckled. “So ye owes
me tuppence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was amused at her grandfather’s magnificent mendacity—his
lordly way of carrying off his pennilessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind the twopence now,” she said. “You haven’t
seen Methusalem, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had supposed it so often that she took the answer for
granted. This reply struck her like a cannon-ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not since ’Lijah Skindle took him away this marnin’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elijah Skindle took him!” she gasped, breathless yet
relieved. “What for? Where?” Had her grandfather’s fears
been justified then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To his ’orspital, Oi reckon. Trottin’ behind the trap he
was, tied to it. A sick ’oss don’t want to goo that pace though,
thinks Oi. ’Twould be before bever,” he added, when she
demanded the exact hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was at church! But Methusalem wasn’t sick when
I left home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must ha’ been took sick—or it stands to reason your Gran’fer
wouldn’t ha’ let him goo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Gran’fer didn’t know——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arxin’ your pardon, Jinny—Mr. Quarles waved to ’em as
they went off. And Oi’ll be thankful to you for the tuppence,
needin’ my Sunday beer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She groped in her purse. “But if Mr. Skindle took him back
to Chipstone, how comes it nobody has seen him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went roundabouts by Bog Lane and Squash End,
’tis all droied-up nowadays. And took Bidlake’s Ferry, Oi
reckon, stead o’ the bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sinister feeling, as yet formless, began to creep into Jinny’s
veins. Handing the nondescript his twopence and the jay
feather, she ran out of the wood and then in the dusking owl-light
by a field-path, and through a prickly hedge of dog-rose and
blackberry that left her with scratched fingers, into her own
little plot of ground. The stable door was now locked, though
its aching emptiness was still visible through the weather-boarding
as she passed by; the house-door was even more securely fastened,
and all the windows were tightly closed. She rattled the casement
of the living-room and heard her grandfather finally
hobbling down the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He examined her cautiously through the little panes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’ve left me in the dark,” he complained, turning the
window-clasp. “Oi’m famished. Where you been gaddin’ in
that frock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you send Methusalem away?” she cried impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put a scooped hand to his ear. “What be you a-sayin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open the door!” she called angrily. “You mustn’t shut
me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to be careful, Jinny.” He moved to the door.
“There’s a sight o’ bad charriters about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed. What did Mr. Skindle want here?” she asked,
as the bolts shot back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Skindle!” He pondered. “Young ’Lijah, d’ye mean? He
brought me a pot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was long ago—what did he want this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This marnin’? Oh, ay”—the sidelong look returned with
remembrance and was succeeded by one of defiance—“That’s
my business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A terrible suspicion flashed upon Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t sold Methusalem?” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced. “That’s <span class='it'>my</span> property. Daniel Quarles, Carrier.
And by the good rights, Oi——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>have</span> sold him!” she hissed in a fury strange to herself.
And she found herself shaking the old man by the arms, shaking
him as he had shaken her that very morning in the small hours.
And he was cowering before her, the fierce old man, cowering
there on his own doorstep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi couldn’t see ye starve,” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s not me you were thinking of!” she said harshly, not
caring whether she was just or not. “You might have trusted
yourself to me after all these years.” Indignation at Elijah’s
supposed swindling mingled with her wrath—the idea of his
getting Methusalem, an animal worth his weight in gold, for a
miserable five-pound note! She gave the old man a final
shake, imaginatively intended for Mr. Skindle. “Where’s the
money?” she cried, letting him go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He recovered himself somewhat. “That’s <span class='it'>my</span> money,” he
said sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where have you put it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cunning and obstinacy mingled in his eye. “Oi’ve put it safe
agin all they thieves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe you’ve got any money!” she said, matching
cunning by cunning. “You just let Mr. Skindle rob you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noa, Oi dedn’t. Oi got more than Methusalem was worth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really? More than a sovereign?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A suvran!” He cackled with a crafty air. “More than
double that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than two sovereigns?” said Jinny in tones of ingenuous
admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than double that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than four sovereigns?” Enthusiasm shone in her eyes
through the dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hurried towards the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not going to bed?” she called with mock anxiety.
“You haven’t had supper!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have plenty o’ supper now. He, he!” His gleeful
cackle descended from the winding staircase. Before he returned,
chuckling still, she had lit the lamp and put out some cold
rabbit-pie and a jug of beer on the tiger-painted tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A foiver!” he cried, waving it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She snatched at the note and tore it in two and let the pieces
flutter away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! Thieves! She’s robbed me,” screamed the Gaffer.
He scrambled on his knees after the fragments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! How dare you sell Methusalem?” He cowered
again before her passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was eating us out of house and home!” he whimpered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up! There’s your supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose like a scolded child, clutching the scraps of thin paper.
She put on her bonnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where ye gooin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Mr. Skindle, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too late for that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ye won’t git Methusalem back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, won’t I, though!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ye’ve tore up his foiver!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care.” But alarmed at heart over her insane deed,
she took the pieces from his unresisting hand and put them in
her purse. “Don’t bolt me out or I’ll break the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But listen, dearie, Mr. Skindle won’t be there—the place’ll
be shut up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the better. I’ll break it in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s the good o’ that? Poor old Methusalem’s out
o’ his misery by now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her heart stood still. “What do you mean?” She was
white and shaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lijah kills at seven,” he said, “afore his supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my God!” she gasped, the completeness of the tragedy
impinging on her for the first time. “You sold him to be killed!
No, no!” she cried, recovering. “He wouldn’t give five pounds
just for a carcase!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then ef that ain’t killed yet,” said the Gaffer, “that won’t
be till to-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sensible remark for once, Jinny thought, subsiding almost
happily into a chair. It had been silly even to contemplate
setting out afresh after all the day’s journeyings. In this
weather the doomed horses would be shut up in Mr. Skindle’s
field,—she recalled their joyous gambollings—the first thing in
the morning she would set out to the rescue. And yet what if
her grandfather should be wrong, what if Mr. Skindle killed
before breakfast! No, delay might be fatal, and she started up
afresh and, unlocking the stable-door, brought in her lantern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’re not gooin’ to Mr. Skindle at this time o’ day?”
protested the Gaffer from his soothing tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must.” She lit the candle in the lantern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, give my love to his mother!” She thought it sarcasm
and went off even more embittered against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not gone far before she met the returning reveller.
Nip’s ears were abased and his eyes edge-long, but in an instant,
aware she was glad of his company, he welcomed her roysterously
to it. But the blackness that now began to fall upon the pair
was not wholly of the night. Great livid thunder-clouds were
sagging over them, and of a sudden the whole landscape was lit
up with blue blazings and shaken with terrific thunder. And
then came the rain—the long-prayed-for rain, with its rich
rejoicing gurgle. Providence, importuned on all sides, now
asserted itself in a pour that was like solid sheets of water, and
the parched soil seemed swilled in a few seconds. To plough
along was not only difficult but foolhardy. Heaven had clearly
thrown cold water on the project. She crept almost shame-facedly
back to her still guzzling grandfather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got a wettin’,” he chuckled. “Sarve ye right to be sow
obstropolus. And sarve <span class='it'>you</span> right too!” he added, launching a
kick towards the shivering and dripping animal. Nip, though
untouched, uttered a dreadful howl, and grovelled on his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to kill them both?” cried Jinny. She was now
sure that Methusalem was beyond reprieve—the point of Mr.
Skindle’s strategy in purchasing him, so as to leave her no
sphere but matrimony, was penetrating to her mind, and, by the
side of such “a dirty bit,” Will’s frank and blusterous methods
began to appear magnanimity itself. To have found out, too,
probably from Bundock, that she would be away at the wedding!
The sly skunk!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>For a full hour after Nip and her grandfather slept the sleep of
the innocent in their beds, she sat up watching the storm, with
no surprise at this unrest of the elements. No less a cataclysm
was adequate to the passing of Methusalem. This sympathy of
Nature indeed relieved her, some of her stoniness melted, and
her face—as if in reciprocation—became as deluged as the
face of the earth-mother. All the long years with Methusalem
passed before her vision, ever since that first meeting of theirs
outside the Watch Vessel: their common adventures in sunshine
and snow, in mud and rain, her whip only an extra tail for him
to whisk off his flies withal: ah, the long martyrdom from those
flies, especially the nose-fly that spoilt the glory of July. She
heard again that queer tick-tack of his hoofs, his whinnying, his
coughing, saw the spasmodic shudder of his shoulder-joints, the
peculiar gulp with which he took his drench. How often they
had gone together to have a nail fixed, or his shoes roughed for
the winter! What silly alarms he had felt, when she had had
to soothe him like a mother, coax him to pass something, and on
the other hand what a skill beyond hers in going unguided
through the moonless, swift-fallen winter night! How happily
he had nibbled at the beans in his corner-crib or the oats in his
manger, what time he was brushed and combed—would that
beloved mane get into rats’-tails no more? Was she never
again to feel that soft nose against her cheek in a love passing
the love of man? Could all this cheery laborious vitality have
ended, be one with the dust she had so often brushed from his
fetlocks? That joy which had set him frisking like an uncouth
kitten when he was released from the shafts, was it not to be his
now that he was freed for ever? Was he to be nothing but a
carcase? Nay—horror upon horror—would he survive only as
glove-or boot-buttons, as that wretch of a Skindle calculated?
Would that triumphant tail wave only at human funerals, his
own last rites unpaid? A remembrance of her glimpse at the
charnel-house made her almost sick. Fed to the foxhounds
perhaps! Could such things be in a God-governed world?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And her cart too would go—of the old life there would be
nothing left any more. She could see the bill pasted up on the
barn-doors: “Carrier’s Cart on Springs, with Set of Harness,
Cart Gear, Back Bands, Belly Bands——” But what nonsense!
Who would advertise such a ramshackle ruin? “A Shabby,
Cracked Canvas Tilt, Patched with Sacking”—fancy that on a
poster! No, like its horse, it would be adjudged fit only to be
broken up. Perhaps somebody wearing Methusalem on his
shoes would sit on the bar of a stile made of its axle-tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She woke from her reverie and to the wetness of her face,
streaming with bitter-sweet tears. The moon rode almost full,
and in the pale blue spread of sky sparse stars shone, one or two
twinkling. She opened the door and went out into the night.
What delicious wafts of smells after the long mugginess of the
day! The elms and poplars rose in mystic lines bordering the
great bare spaces. Surely the death of Methusalem had been
but a nightmare—if she went to the stable, there would he be
as usual, snug and safe in his straw. She sped thither, over the
sodden grass, with absolute conviction. Alas, the same endless
emptiness yawned, the manger looked strange and tragic in the
moonlight. She thought of a divine infant once lying in one,
wrapped in his swaddling-clothes, and then looking up skywards
she saw a figure hovering. Yes, it was—it was the Angel-Mother,
so beautiful in the azure light. At the sight all her anguish was
dissolved in sweetness. “Mother! Mother!” she cried,
stretching up her arms to the vision. “Comfort thee, my child!”
came the dulcet tones. “Methusalem is not dead, but sleeping!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the glad news Jinny burst into tears, and, in the mist they
made, her mother faded away. But she walked in soft happiness
back to the house, and said her prayers of gratitude and went
believingly to bed and slept as when she was a babe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So long did she sleep that when she woke, the old man was
standing over her again, just as the morning before, save that
now he was in his everyday earth-coloured smock and wore a
frown instead of a wedding-look, and the sunshine was streaming
into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s my breakfus, Jinny?” he said grumpily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry,” she said, yawning and rubbing her eyes. “I
must have overslept myself.” And then she remembered Mr.
Pennymole’s story, and a smile came over her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nawthen to laugh at,” he said savagely. “Ef ye goo
out at bull’s noon, ye’re bound to forgit my breakfus. And that
eatin’ his head off too! Ye know there’s no work for him. Ye
dedn’t want to bring him back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back?” she almost screamed. “Is Methusalem back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As ef ye dedn’t know!” he said, disgusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Disregarding him and everything else, she sprang out of bed,
rolling the blanket round her, and with bare feet she sped to the
stable. But she had hardly got outside before the jet of hope
had sunk back. It was but another of her grandfather’s
delusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no! O incredible, miraculous, enchanting spectacle!
There he was, the dear old beast, not dead but sleeping, exactly
as the Angel-Mother had said, not a hair of his mane injured,
not an inch of his tail less, and never did two Polynesian lovers
rub noses half so passionately as this happy pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny would have rubbed his nose still more adoringly had she
known—as she knew later—the rôle it had played in his salvation.
The threatening thunder-clouds had made Mr. Skindle put
off his slaughtering till the morning, so that he himself might
get home before the storm broke. The doomed horses he left
shut in his field—who cared whether <span class='it'>they</span> got wet? But as soon as
the coast was clear of Skindle and his latest-lingering myrmidons,
Methusalem had simply lifted the latch of the gate with his
nose and gone home. Mr. Skindle, oblivious of this accomplishment
of his, though he had seen it practised on his never-forgotten
journey with Jinny, had imagined him conclusively corralled.
Mr. Charles Mott, returning with some boon companions from a
distant hostelry where the draughts were more generous than
he was allowed at “The Black Sheep,” was among the few who
saw the noble animal hurrying homewards, and he told Jinny the
next Tuesday that she ought to enter Methusalem for the
Colchester Stakes. His unusual rate of motion was also reported
by Miss Gentry, who, lying awake with a headache after the
excitement of the day, had heard him snort past her window
just when the storm was ebbing. He must have sagely sheltered
while it raged and have arrived at Blackwater Hall soon after
Jinny had beheld her vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as yet Jinny attributed the miracle to her Angel-Mother.
And what a happy Sunday morning was that, with the church
bells all clearly ringing “Come and thank God and her!” She
did not fail to obey them, though not without a sharp turn in
that padlock, and with the little key safe in her bosom. And
having happily ascertained from Mother Gander that the five-pound
note was valid in pieces, she dropped them into Mr.
Skindle’s letter-box together with remarks that drew heavily on
her Spelling-Book’s “Noun Adjectives of Four Syllables.”
<span class='it'>Cadaverous</span> (Belonging to a Carcase); <span class='it'>Execrable</span> (Hateful,
Accursed); <span class='it'>Sophistical</span> (Captious, Deceitful); <span class='it'>Sulphureous</span> (Full
of Brimstone); and <span class='it'>Vindictive</span> (Belonging to an Apology) were
among her proudest specimens. They were not calculated to
encourage Mr. Skindle’s matrimonial hopes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Pitter-patter</span> was the dominant note of the rest of the year.
The prayer for rain had been only too successful, and the blackbirds
whistled their thanksgiving over their worms. But
humanity grumbled with its wonted ingratitude. There were
warm and windy days, and cold and sparkling days, but the roads
never quite dried up. The short cuts to Frog Farm became
impassable for Bundock; in the coursing season the long-grassed
marshlands clove to the spectators’ gaiters, and when the beagles
were out, Jinny had the satisfaction of seeing Farmer Gale and
breathless bumpkins floundering over sodden stubble-fields or
ankle-deep in mud, what time baffled whippers-in piped plaintively,
or jetted husky cries at their scattered pack. Glad as
she was to eat of the leporine family, she detested sport for
sport’s sake, even the fox-hunting, though her poultry-run had
just been raided and a dog-fox had snarled fearlessly at Nip
from the ditch. Once, when the hare, crossing her cart with
the dogs at his very heels, cleared the broad ditch with a magnificent
leap, Jinny clapped her hands as though at a Flippance
melodrama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sport for life’s sake was another affair, and she looked back
regretfully to the good old times described by her grandfather,
when the farmer, having finished his day’s work, would go out
rabbit-shooting to preserve his crop, or when the fox could be
shot, snared, or even hooked, as a dangerous animal. Now, when
poor old Uncle Lilliwhyte had found Jinny’s vulpine enemy dead
in one of his gins, caught by a claw, that rising vet., Mr. Skindle,
was called in to make a post-mortem examination, and it was
only because he certified that the sacred animal had died of
starvation, and not been poisoned, that the old woodman escaped
the worst rigours of the unwritten law. As it was, his crime in
setting the trap at all on land not his own, and his failing—through
a new attack of rheumatism—to examine it before the
fox died, almost resulted in his being officially driven from his
derelict hut into the Chipstone poorhouse; a fate he only escaped
by passionate asseverations that he had always been and till death
would continue “upright,” by which he meant “independent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was in one sense more than Jinny could call herself,
for her store of barley or rye for her breadmaking was dangerously
low, and she had come to depend a good deal on the
food brought by this queer raven at prices more corresponding
to his gratitude than to market value. She still peddled her
goats’ milk for a trifle among her neighbours, the abundant
blackberries gave her fruit (though she could not afford the sugar
for jam), she had gathered nuts as industriously as a squirrel,
she ensured jelly for her grandfather by making it out of her
own apples, while by exchanging the bad apples with a neighbour
who kept pigs, she got Methusalem some “green fodder” in the
shape of tares. But it was an unceasing strain to keep things
going in the old style, and Uncle Lilliwhyte’s spoils were more
than welcome, for his activities varied from codling-fishing to
eel-spearing, and from fowling on the saltings to collecting glass-wort
for pickling. His rabbits and hares came with suspiciously
injured legs, and Jinny seeing the bloody-blobbed eyes could
only hope they had not been long in his wire loops. As she felt
the long, warm, beautiful bodies, she had to tell herself how
pernicious they were to the root-crops or the young apple-trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More legitimate spoils arrived when the old man was well
enough to crawl to the nearest salt-marsh with his ancient fowling-piece,
for, when the ebb bared the mud, countless sea-birds came
to feed, and more than once a brace of mallards offered Jinny a
vivid image of her inferiority to the rival carrier, so gorgeously
shimmering was the male’s head, so drab the female’s. For
while the driver of the Flynt Flyer had been blossoming out in
the frock-coat he had first sported for the Flippance wedding,
Jinny had been refraining even from her furbished-up gown,
reserving it mentally for a last resource and feeling herself lucky
that it was still unpawned. But one day when the vehicles met—for
despite the heaviness of the going Jinny foolishly and
extravagantly continued to plod her miry rounds—she caught
Will looking down so compassionately at her spotting shoes that
she straightway resolved to buy another pair at any sacrifice.
Savage satisfaction at her defeat she could have borne, but this
pity she would not brook. Better sell the goats, especially as
Gran’fer would need a new flannel shirt for the winter. The
animals were not very lucrative, and one out of the three would
suffice to supply milk for herself and—by its bleat—her grandfather’s
sense of stability. But she had reckoned insufficiently
with this last: he admitted he had no great stomach for her
goats’ cheese, and felt a middling need for flannel, but he clung
to his nannies as though without them his world would fall to
pieces. That her shoes were doing so, he did not remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the end—though she shrank from the three golden balls on
her own behalf—there was nothing for it but to pledge her
wedding-frock under pretence it was a customer’s. But in her
dread lest the pawnbroker should recognize the dress, the sharpness
which extracted the utmost from him for her distressed
clients was replaced by a diffident acceptance of barely enough
for the shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This discussion about her live stock, however, gave her an idea.
She carted part of her poultry to and fro in a crate, and their
clucking and fluttering gave an air of liveliness to the business
and made even Will Flynt believe it had woke up again, especially
as he saw the smart new shoes on the little feet, supplemented
presently by a new winter bonnet, which, despite his experience
with his own mother’s bonnet, he did not divine was merely an
old one, whitened and remodelled by Miss Gentry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the equinoctial season found the little Carrier still upon
her seat, defiant of competition and radiating prosperity from
the crown of her bonnet to the sole of her shoe. Even the plainness
of her skirt and shawl seemed only an adaptation to the
weather. But she would have been better off by her log fire,
making the local variety of Limerick lace with which she was on
other days trying to eke out her infrequent sixpences. Though
the rain abated towards the end of October, halcyon days and
even hours alternated with hours and days of turbulent winds
and hailstorms, and the sky would change in almost an instant
from a keen blue, with every perspective standing out clear and
sun-washed, to a lowering roof of clouds spitting hailstones, and
a gentle wind would be succeeded by half a gale that stripped
their flames from the poplars and sent the reddened beech-leaves
whirling fantastically. In November these blasts grew more
biting, Nip cowered in his basket within the cart, and the calves
in the fields sheltered themselves behind the blown-down trunks
of elms. Shivering, Jinny reminded herself that the real object
of her rounds was the bi-weekly gorge at Mother Gander’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were indeed more generous than ever, these midday meals,
so relieved was Jinny’s hostess to find she had not really been
baptized into Mr. Fallow’s church. Mrs. Mott even had the
Gaffer’s beer-barrel replenished gratis. Not that she had any
suspicion of the girl’s straits. Though parcels were no longer
left at the bar for Jinny, the poor woman was too taken up with
her own troubles to draw the deduction from that. Beneath her
imposing blue silk bodice beat a wounded heart, and in Jinny’s
society she found consolation for the lack of her husband’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a quarrel had begun between the Motts which was destined
to shake all Chipstone with its reverberations. Mr. Charles
Mott had profanely refused to be “Peculiar” any longer. The
endeavour to draw him to the Wednesday services had proved
the last straw. To him religion and Sunday were synonyms, and
he had been willing to concede the day to boredom. He was a
sportsman and was ready to play fair. But his wife was not
playing fair, he considered, when she pretended that ratting,
coursing, and dicing remained reprehensible even on weekdays.
Expostulatory elders had vainly pointed out to him that it was
only the Churchman who made so much of Sunday and so little
of every other day, and Deacon Mawhood had been compelled
to order several goes of rum at “The Black Sheep” to find
opportunities of explaining to its landlord that his cravat-pin
and plethora of rings were an offence. Let him note how his
admirable wife had given up her gold chain. “Well, I don’t
want no chain,” Charley had retorted, and his cronies still
acclaimed the repartee. He had, in fact, broken his chain and
would not even go to the Sunday chapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and me have both got our cross to bear,” Deacon Mawhood
sighed sympathetically to the distraught lady. “There’s
saints among us as won’t even keep a cat or a bird because the
thought of them may come ’twixt the soul and chapel. Oi sometimes
suspicion it’s a failing in roighteousness to keep a husband or
a wife—partic’lar when they riots on your hard-earned savings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grievances which the poor hostess of “The Black Sheep”—now
become a keeper of one—poured into Jinny’s ear, fully
confirmed all the Spelling-Book had told her of the wickedness
of man—its preoccupation with the male gender had left woman
unimpugned. But it was more under Mr. Mawhood’s encouragement
than Jinny’s that this female pillar of the chapel now sent
the Bellman round Chipstone with his bell and his cocked hat
and his old French cry, to inform all and sundry that she would
not be responsible for her husband’s debts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a procedure which scandalized Chipstone. Since the
day when a neighbouring village had set up its “cage” for
drunken men in the pound, with the other strayed beasts, no
such blow had been dealt at the dignity of man. But Charley
and his crew met it with derisory laughter. All Mrs. Mott’s
property was his—or rather theirs: he could sell the lease of
“The Black Sheep” over her head, if she did not behave herself.
Nay, he could sell her very self at the market cross, the bolder
maintained, not without citing precedent. By many the Bellman
was blamed for compromising the dignity of his sex: by
none so contemptuously as by Bundock. For the Crier, not
taking his own announcement seriously, had embellished it with
facetious gags that set the street roaring. “I wouldn’t say if
they were funny,” complained Bundock. “Anybody can play
on the word ‘Peculiar,’ and certainly peculiar it is to put your
husband in the stocks, so to speak. I don’t deny Charley’s legs
sometimes need that support. But what can you expect if you
marry your pot-boy? You must take pot-luck. He, he, he!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To which the bulk of Chipstone Christendom added that however
prodigal the ex-potman, he did not waste so much money
as his wife lavished on that ridiculous sect of hers. A hundred
pounds for the bishop at his jubilee birthday, it was said with
bated breath—“a noice fortune!” Really, Charley was only
too long-suffering not to take his property, including his wife,
more strictly in hand, and when it was learnt that lawyers’
letters were actually passing between the bedrooms of the parties
there was general satisfaction. In short, public opinion was as
outraged by Mrs. Mott’s treatment of her husband as by her
original acquisition of him. The only difference was that Mr.
Mott was now a martyr.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The insult to the male sex was especially resented by the
tradesmen to whom the martyr stood so profitably indebted,
and under their incitement a new ban might have been put on
“The Black Sheep” but for the reluctance of Will Flynt, who,
though second to none in reprobation, refused to shift the headquarters
of his coach to the rival establishment. That would
only be hurting Charley’s business, he pointed out, and indirectly
themselves. The economic aspects of revenge had not occurred
to these muddle-heads, and they were grateful to the coach-driver
for the reminder. They did not know that his true
motive for sticking to “The Black Sheep” was that Jinny was
to be encountered in its courtyard on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Nor was Jinny herself aware how profusely she was repaying
Mrs. Mott for her meals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if this scandal among the “Peculiars” was not enough,
Deacon Mawhood himself came into ill odour more literally. For
in carrying out his agreement to clear the Gentry cottage of rats,
he had committed the crime of which Uncle Lilliwhyte had been
acquitted: he had operated by poison, to wit, and the stench
of the dead vermin in their holes nearly crazed the excellent
dressmaker, already sufficiently distracted by the silence of her
bosom friend, Mrs. Flippance, swallowed up in Boulogne as in a
grave. Miss Gentry, like Mother Gander, now wept on Jinny’s
shoulder, though it had to be done outside the garden gate, and
even there the wafts caught one. If it had not been for the
prediction that she would be drowned, did she ever set foot on
a boat, she would have been in Boulogne weeks ago with her
darling, but, like a ghost, she could not cross water. Indeed she
would already have been a ghost but for her strong smelling-salts,
her decoction of scabious against infection, and the fumigation
of the cottage. Jinny did not shrink from bearding her spiritual
superior in his bar and giving Mr. Joshua Mawhood a taste of
her tongue. If that was his notion of religion, he ought to be
cast out of his chapel, and she would let Mrs. Mott know of
what a hoggish “illusion” he had been guilty—(<span class='it'>Illusion</span>, Sham
or Cheat—“The Universal Spelling-Book”).</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Deacon, standing on the letter of his bond, was impermeable
to reproach—nay, had a sense of righteousness, as having
incidentally punished a distributor of tracts no less offensive
than his dead rats. Not even the remonstrances of Mr. Fallow,
who had arranged the compromise over Mrs. Mawhood’s dress,
could bring the Deacon to a sense of sin, still less of compensation.
“Her rats were eating the pears like hollamy,” he said,
“and Oi’ve cleared cottage and orchard of ’em.” Mr. Fallow was
so interested to know what “hollamy” was, that he went away
with a diminished sense of failure. But neither dictionaries nor
octogenarians could throw any light on its etymology. The
most plausible conjecture he could reach was that it must be
“hogmanay,” gifts made at the year’s end.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But if the Peculiar Faith was thus involved in scandal, Churchmanship
did not fail to provide its quota of gossip to the months
that ended a fateful year. It was not only that Miss Blanche of
Foxearth Farm had collected the scalp of yet another suitor (and
one who, as Bundock’s own eyes had witnessed at the Flippance
wedding-feast, had been wantonly encouraged); it was that the
minx, whose brother Barnaby went about in October saying
Will Flynt was not good enough for her, became openly engaged
in November to that obviously inferior specimen, Mr. Elijah
Skindle. And old Giles Purley, tired of vagaries so incongruous
in a churchwarden’s family, was, said Bundock’s father, imperiously
hurrying on the match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although it was the postman who was the reference on the
liberties permitted to Will at the wedding breakfast, it was his
bedridden parent who became the leading authority on the new
Blanche engagement. That was because Barnaby, disappointed
of the wider life of the Tony Flip theatre, with no winter prospect
but that of chopping down undergrowth and laying it out in
long rows for hoops and hurdles, and receiving no consolation
from Jinny when their vehicles passed, had discovered in the
postman’s youngest sister a being even more beauteous, and,
when he had to take the trap into Chipstone, never failed in
devoted attendance on the sick-bed. It was thus that all the
world knew that the Flippances had not written once from
Boulogne, not even to send on the promised cheque for the
wedding-breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even Bundock’s father had not the true history of the
engagement, constructing as he did from Barnaby’s chatter a
facile version of a “better match”: how dear ’Lijah was coining
money far quicker than Will with his petty fares and commissions,
and fast ousting Jorrow, and with what elegant furniture he was
fitting up the bridal bedchamber. Barnaby himself did not
know that with the gradual vanishing of his sister’s theatrical
and operatic hopes, Blanche, immeasurably more embittered and
disillusioned than himself, had sought in vain to win back Will,
and had thrown herself first strategically and then despairingly
into the arms of Elijah, who, summoned professionally to the Farm,
had found unhoped-for consolation for his lost Jinny. Tongues
would have wagged still more joyously had it been known that
Will for his part was trying to win back Jinny, who in her turn
was as adamantine to him as he to Blanche. The two Carriers
met not seldom on the miry, yellow-carpeted roads awhirl with
flying leaves, or in the rainy courtyard of “The Black Sheep,”
and for each the scene at once shifted to a sunny tangled fairyland
where the wood-pigeon purred, and oak, elm, beech, and
silver birch in ample leaf rose in a crescent, with crisp beech-nuts
underfoot, and baby bracken. But not even Nip could effect
any visible communication. Much more gracious was Jinny to
Barnaby, as soon as she was relieved of his “passing” adoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather improved for a space in mid-November. There
was a bite in the air and the sheep-bells tinkled keenly from the
pastures. The morning hoar-frosts held till noon. A great red
ball of sun and a pale yellow crescent moon would shine together
in the heavens, early sunsets seen through bare branches seemed
to fill them with a golden fruitage that changed slowly to lemon,
and the haystacks rose magically through enchanted hazes. But
the cold only made Jinny hungrier and the earth-beauty sadder.
It was as if she had already forgotten the blessing of Methusalem’s
return, and as if carrying was not after all the heart’s deepest
dream—especially with nothing to carry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a relief to be blocked occasionally by Master Peartree’s
sheep, billowing along like a yellow Nile, and to exchange conversation
with the shepherd, now at the most leisured moment
of his year. Patiently she would hear how the sheep got
ravenous in the high cold winds, why he was driving them out
of yon danger-zone of rape and turnip, and how the only real
anxiety between now and Christmas was that one might fall on
its back, or the hunt frighten the ewes: for soon somehow he
would be speaking of his next-wall neighbours in Frog Farm, and
somehow the family would always narrow to Will. “A grumpy,
runty lad,” he described him once. “Sometimes he goos about
full o’ mum: other times you can yer him through the wall
grizzlin’ and growlin’ like my ould dog, time my poor missus had
her fust baiby. He’d ha’ torn the child to pieces,” he went on,
diverging into an exposition of how sheep-dogs had to be trained
to prepare for babies. But she cut it as short as she dared,
inquiring, “But who’d he be jealous of?” “The baiby—Oi’m
explainin’ to you!” he said. “No, I mean, who’s young Mr.
Flynt jealous of?” she asked, wondering how Will could know
that she had been shedding such gracious smiles on Barnaby.
And when the shepherd replied “ ’Lijah Skindle, in course,” she
winced perceptibly. But though the sting of the reply rankled,
she was not so sure as the rest of the world that it was true.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The abundance of black sloes, they said, foretold a hard winter,
and as the winter approached, Jinny’s outlook grew darker.
Even to keep a roof over their heads was not easy with the
thatch everywhere holed by starlings. Driblets came through
the old man’s bedroom ceiling and were caught in a pail. And
as for the walls, Daniel Quarles cursed the builder who had put
in such bad mortar that “big birds came and picked the grit
out o’ the lime.” The rain drove even through the closed
lattices. To keep the living-room dry, he had made Jinny
purchase putty, of which he daubed no less than three pounds
over the rotting woodwork of the window. A stumpy piece of
log he also nailed to the bottom of the window to block up the
crevices, though he could do nothing with the top of the kitchen
door through the little vine that grew over it, and which in some
years yielded several pounds of small white grapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if it was high time that her Hall should be patched up, Jinny
often thought with commiseration of poor Uncle Lilliwhyte in
his leaky hut throughout all these rains. Even from a selfish
point of view, his health was a consideration. If he broke up, a
main source of supply would disappear, and any day he might
be at least temporarily paralysed by his rheumatism, and need
provender instead of supplying it. A frail reed indeed to rely
on, and Jinny began to wonder if she had been wise in training
Nip so carefully <span class='it'>not</span> to hunt rabbits. With food and shelter thus
alike insecure, Jinny, remembering the formula of her sect,
resolved to “ask in faith.” Perhaps too conscious a resolution
impaired the faith—at any rate Providence, even with an
accessory at court in the shape of the Angel-Mother, proved
stony, and the Angel-Mother herself appeared limited in her
powers, however limitless her sympathy. She could not even
make folks demand tambour lace. Jinny began to wonder if no
terrestrial powers remained to be invoked in the old man’s behalf.
What had become of all the children, whose names were recorded
in the fly-leaf of his hereditary Bible, and only some of whom had
their deaths chronicled? Cautiously she probed and pried into
corners she had never dared approach before, instinctively
feeling them full of cobwebs and grime. And her instinct was
justified—each child had been more “obstropolus” than the
others. One of the daughters was always “a slammacks” and
had married beneath her, another—a beauty even fairer than
Jinny’s mother—had, on the contrary, caught a London linen-draper
on his holidays and looked down on her father, who
would starve rather than eat a bit of her bread. One boy had
“ ’listed,” another been beguiled into the Navy by that “dirty
little Dap,” a third—a lanky youth nicknamed “Ladders”—had
gone to London to see the coronation of King William, and
had disappeared, while his devil-may-care younger brother had
shot a rabbit at night and been transported to “Wan Demon’s
Land,” a name that made Jinny shudder. This last was the
only son of whose present locality he was even vaguely aware,
though, oddly enough, the sailor son had once sent him word
that, landing with a boat’s crew upon an island called “Wan
Couver,” he had come upon “Ladders” in the service of the
Hudson Bay Company, living in a stockaded fort called after
the Queen, and surrounded by naked, painted Indians. But as
none of these children were ever to dare cross their father’s
doorstep again, there did not seem much help to be looked for
from any quarter of the globe that might contain them. And
Jinny was sorry she had not left the cobwebbed corners in their
original mystery, for as the stories multiplied, the old man began
to loom as a sort of sinister raven that drives out its own offspring,
though gradually she came to see behind all the stories
the same tale of a cast-iron religion against which the young
generation broke itself. Or was it only a cast-iron obstinacy, she
asked herself, after working out that the first at least of these
family jars must have occurred before her grandfather’s oft-narrated
encounter with John Wesley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with a new astonishment that she learnt he had been
careful to make his will, lest Blackwater Hall should fall into the
hands of his youngest surviving rascal. “And who’ve you left
it to?” she inquired innocently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, who has the nat’ral right to it? Sidrach, in course,
as ought to has had it ’stead o’ me, he bein’ the eldest. He’s
been cut out o’ the wote, too, what goos with the property and
what’s worth pounds and pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was so convinced of the righteousness of this will, and
appeared so genuinely fond of his brother, that Jinny was afraid
to suggest the strong probability of Sidrach predeceasing him.
Indeed Sidrach began now to play a larger and larger part in his
thoughts, his mind reverted to the early days of the “owler,”
and gradually the prosperity of those days shone again over the
patriarch in “Babylon.” Sidrach now loomed as a star of hope,
and Daniel spoke constantly of paying his long-projected visit
to him at Chelmsford, designing apparently to drive the cart
himself, and to inform his brother of the magnanimous bequest
that was coming to him—a legacy that would suggest to Sidrach
corresponding magnanimity in the living present. Afraid the
Gaffer would actually set forth on this dangerous and visionary
quest, Jinny did her best to discredit the notion of Sidrach’s
opulence, and quoted “Rolling stones gather no moss,” but the
Gaffer argued tenaciously that if his eldest brother had not been
comfortably off, he would have come to seek the shelter of their
roof-tree, or at least applied for their assistance, as he must be
getting old, or at least (he modified it) too old to work. Jinny
offered to write to Sidrach to inquire, but her grandfather could
not find the ten-year-old letter inviting the visit. No, he would
go over and find Sidrach instead, and Jinny was reduced to
pointing out from day to day how unfavourable the weather was
for the excursion. As the days grew shorter and shorter, the
project, finding no opposition to nourish it, seemed to subside.
Jinny was almost conscience-stricken when one Sunday after
church Mr. Fallow showed her a paragraph in the <span class='it'>Chelmsford
Chronicle</span>, stating that “another link with the past” had been
broken by the death “last Monday from a fall downstairs” in
the Chelmsford poorhouse of a centenarian named Sidrach
Quarles, who claimed to be a hundred and five, and who was
certainly well over the hundred, his recollections, which were a
source of entertainment to all visitors, going back to the days
when England was still ruled by a “furriner,” meaning thereby
George II.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shock Jinny received at this was more of life than of
death. It made her realize she had never quite believed in
Sidrach’s existence, and this sense of his substantiality almost
swamped the minor fact of his decease. She saw no reason why
he should not remain substantial. Now that she had perhaps
been guilty of baulking her grandfather’s last chance of seeing
his beloved brother, she did not feel equal to robbing him of his
last hope of assistance. He might even agitate himself over
making a fresh will, and it was far better to let Providence or
the lawyer folk decide on his heir. No doubt when the dread
necessity arose, the youngest son would be raked up from somewhere.
But that dark moment still seemed far. The longer her
grandfather lived, the more she had got used to the idea of his
never dying. True, Sidrach had died, though his habit of living
had been even more ingrained, but they did not take proper care
of you in a workhouse, and besides he had died of an accident.
She would keep Daniel from that fate, even as she would keep
him from the poorhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she sat at his side by the fire that Sunday night, knitting
him a muffler, her thoughts were playing so pitifully over poor
old Sidrach in his bleak pauper’s grave, that she was not at all
surprised when her grandfather announced with sudden decision
that he would go to see Sidrach the very next day. With
a chill at her heart as though a dead hand had been placed on
it, she told him gently that it was nonsense and that he must
wait now till the spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he shook his head obstinately. “Don’t seem as ef Oi’ll
last out till the spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed forcedly. “What an idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless there’s an election and Oi can buy grub with my
wote-money,” he explained. “And Oi ain’t heerd as Parlyment
is considerin’ the likes of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve always had plenty to eat!” she protested, colouring
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t enough in the larder when Oi looks, ne yet for
Methusalem in the barn. Ye’ve got to have a store like the beer
in my barrel. Where’s my flitch? Where’s my cheeses?
Same as we’re snowbound, like the year Sidrach went away,
where would Oi get my Chris’mus dinner? ’Tis a middlin’ long
way to Babylon, but Oi’ll start with the daylight and be back
between the lights, and ef Oi’m longer, why the moon’s arly.
Oi’ll be proper pleased to see dear Sidrach again—he larnt me
my letters and Oi’ll bring him back to live with us, now he’s
gittin’ oldish. It ain’t good for a man to live alone, says the
Book, and that’ll be good for us too, he bein’ as full o’ suvrans
as a dog of fleas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nip isn’t full of fleas,” she said with mock anger, hoping to
make a diversion. “Why, you scrub him yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he went on, unheeding. “Daniel Quarles has allus been
upright, and he’d sooner die than goo to his darter or the poorhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought miserably that the poorhouse was where he would
have to go to find any traces of his beloved Sidrach, and she set
herself by every device of logic or cajolery to discourage this revived
dream of the journey. He might not even find Sidrach in
such a big city, she now hinted, but he laughed at that. Everybody
knew Sidrach, “a bonkka, hansum chap with a mosey face
and a woice like the bull of Bashan and as strong too. Wery
short work he’d ha’ made of Master Will. Carry him in, indeed!
Carried him out—and with one hand—that’s what Sidrach
would ha’ done! Why, he’s tall enough to light the street-lamps
in Che’msford!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These street-lamps, Jinny gathered, still figured in his mind
as of oil, and she was able by dexterous draughts on his reminiscences
to put off the evil day of his expedition. But whenever
there was visible dearth at table, the thought of his rich brother,
flared up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could Blackwater Hall perhaps be sold, she thought desperately,
and the money spent on his declining years. The thought was
stimulated by a meeting of the Homage Court which came from
railhead in the “Flynt Flyer,” and before which Miss Gentry’s
landlady as a copyholder had to do “suit and service” in the
Moot Hall to the Lords of the Manor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jinny ascertained that Beacon Chimneys, a ramshackle
place with much land, had been bought up recently by Farmer
Gale for his new bride at fifty shillings an acre, farm and buildings
thrown in; a rate at which Blackwater Hall would not even
yield the forty shillings supposed to be its annual value as a
voting concern—whereas the Gaffer’s view, cautiously extracted,
ran: “Ef you spread suvrans all over my land, each touchin’ the
tother, you pick up your pieces and Oi keep my land.” Moreover,
Mr. Fallow, to whom she had broached the idea, reminded
her feelingly that old people could not be moved. He was
keenly interested, however, to learn that the tenure was an
example of Borough English and hunted up the local Roll of
Customs (7th Edward IV) proclaiming that “Time out of the
Mind of Man” the “ould auncient Custom of the Bourow” had
been for the heritage to go to the “youngest Sonne of the first
wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At heart Jinny was glad the idea of selling the Hall was
impracticable: for what would have become of Methusalem and
the business of “Daniel Quarles, Carrier”? To surrender before
the “Flynt Flyer” would have been a bitter pill indeed.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When all but the last swallows had departed, and Christmas
began to loom in the offing, the Sidrach obsession resurged, and
there being a spell of bright, clear weather, the only way she
could devise to stave off the expedition was to pretend to undertake
it herself. This was the more necessary as she was not
certain the scheme did not cover a crafty design to drive Methusalem
back to the knacker’s for the five pounds. She would
start very early and go, not to Chelmsford, but to “Brandy Hole
Creek.” Instead of waiting her Christmas letter to Commander
Dap, she would visit him personally. He was, after all, a relative
and would not like to see his brother-in-law starve—of course
she would accept nothing for herself. Already she had intended
to skirt the subject at Christmas, but to ask assistance openly
was painful, while if one was too reticent one might be misunderstood.
In conversation one could feel one’s way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So on a misty morning of late November, when the peewits
were calling over the dark fields, she set out, the old man watching
her off with a lantern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do ye bring back Sidrach,” he called after her, “sow we
can all live happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer she blew her horn cheerily, feeling this was less a
lie than speech. She would come back with help of some sort—that
was certain. Whether she would confess that the help
came from Commander Dap or would attribute it to Sidrach, or
whether it would be wiser to come back with the discovery of
Sidrach’s death, trusting to its staleness to blunt the blow and
to the news of Dap’s assistance to overcome it, or whether it
would be imprudent to mention Dap at all, not merely because
it would be hard to explain how she had met the Commander of
the Watch Vessel at Chelmsford, but because her grandfather in
his inveterate venom against Dap was capable of refusing his
favours—on all these distracting alternatives she hoped to make
up her mind during the day. Here, too, she would perhaps have
to feel her way. But she now miserably realized the wisdom of
the Spelling-Book’s “writing-piece”: “Lying may be thought
convenient and profitable because not so soon discovered; but
pray remember, the Evil of it is perpetual: For it brings persons
under everlasting Jealousy and Suspicion; for they are not to
be believed when they speak the Truth, nor trusted, when
perhaps they mean honestly.” She meant honestly enough, God
knew, but into what a tangle she was getting. She consoled
herself with the thought that anyhow there would be no pretending
that day in her business—to spare Methusalem on so
long a journey the empty boxes had been left at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Single drops oozed upon her as she started, but as the mist
lifted, though it revealed sodden, blackened pastures on both
sides of her route, the underlying betterness of the weather
manifested itself, and soon under an arching blue Methusalem
was almost trotting over withering bracken and fallen leaves in
a world of browns and yellows, while an abnormally friendly
robin perching on the cart-shaft, and the scarlet-berried bryony
festooning the hedgerows, contributed with the gleaming holly-berries
to colour her darkling mood. There was a certain
refreshment, too, in going off by this new route, where she for
her part was as unknown. It was odd how the mere turning her
back on the Chipstone Road transformed everything. Even the
path—though this was not so pleasant for Methusalem—had at
first an upward tendency, and her mere passing evoked stares
and comments. This surprised her in turn till she remembered
Will’s disapprobation. She did not realize that the visible
emptiness of the cart, with its implication that she was not
plying, only driving it to some male headquarters, mitigated the
sensation, and she congratulated herself there was no old client
to observe the absence of cargo. In the first few miles she met
no soul she knew except the taciturn lout who had once directed
her to Master Peartree’s shearing-shed, and who was now preparing
a feeding-ground for the flock, pulling out mangolds with
a picker and hurling them over the hurdled field from a broken-pronged
fork. The sheep had to go to this higher ground for fear
of floods, he informed her in a burst of communicativeness, and it
wasn’t half as eatable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing a row of thatched, black-tarred cottages at a moment
when the mothers were coming to the garden gates to speed
their broods to school, she offered lifts till her space was packed
with little ones. The old cart was now alive with youth and
laughter, and the flocks of rooks from the elms were out-chattered.
The road lay between great fields flanked by broad ditches, along
which argosies of yellow leaves went sailing, and there were
shooters with dogs, happy duck-ponds, old towers and steeples,
black barns, gabled old houses with verge-boards over the
windows, quaint inn-signs and mossy-tiled granges, and the
ground kept humping itself and dropping more erratically than
her home circuit, but never sufficiently to spoil the sublime flatness
in which single figures stooping to turn over the soil showed like
quadrupeds in a vast circle. She must needs go a bit out of her way
to reach the school, which lay in a little town on the estuary,
and it was a thrilling moment when from her seat she had her
first far-off glimpse of the very waters that had beglamoured her
childhood—outwardly it was only the gleam as of a white river
with hazy land beyond, and on the hither side a few black huts
looking almost like vessels; but over everything was wrapped a
dreamy peace, which the clamour of the actual children could
not penetrate, while in her nostrils—though it was surely too far
off to be wafted to her—there arose the strange, salty, putrid
odour of fenland, offensive and delectable. And as the road
curved slowly towards the shore, all the charm and mystery of
childhood seemed to be in those barges with the red-brown sails,
those grassy knolls and unlovely mud-flats, in which rotting
boats stuck half sunken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she could deposit her charges in their classrooms
some had dropped off and were looking for treasure in the
flat, dyke-seamed fields. They had arrived too early for school,
they explained. But she felt rewarded for carrying them
to the waterside when she espied the long, low hull and great
brown sail of Bidlake’s barge. With a blast of her horn she
summoned the trio of females, but only the twins mounted to
the deck to wave hands at her as the broad wherry came tacking
and gliding past, the shaggy Ephraim explaining in an indecorous
shout that the missus was to be “laid aside” again, and this time he
was looking around for a nice quiet lodging on shore for her and the
girls. How handsome Sophy and Sally were growing, she
thought, how charmingly they had smiled, just as if she had
never left off bringing them presents. What a comfort they were
so grown up now; they should soon be fending for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the barge was wafted away, she remained on the shore a
few minutes, fascinated by the lattice-work reflection of the
clouds on the water, which through their scudding over it against
the stream seemed to be going in opposite directions at once.
She did not know why this phenomenon was agitating the
recesses of her being; but suddenly there flashed up from the
obscure turmoil the lines of Miss Gentry in her sibylline mood:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>When the Brad in opposite ways shall course,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Lo! Jinny’s husband shall come on a horse,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>And Jinny shall then learn Passion’s force.</span></p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of course this was not the Brad, nor was it really going two
ways at once, and in any case who wanted a husband or Passion?
Clucking so suddenly to Methusalem that his movement scattered
some poultry pecking around him amid golden straw, she turned
up through the High Street. At a fishmonger’s shop she got
down and bought a pennyworth of bloaters for her grandfather’s
supper, the man sliding them off a rod where they hung like
blackened corpses from a gibbet. She was half minded to
inspect the shop of the “Practical Tailor” next door, to see if
she could not pick up something cheap and serviceable for the
old man’s winter wear, but there was nothing in the little house-window,
not even a roll of cloth, except illustrations of men’s
clothing so ultra-fashionable and dear that she was frightened to
go in. “Pacha D’Orsay Chesterfields, Codringtons, Sylphides,
Peltoes, Zephyr Wrappers, etc., etc., every description of Winter
Coat”—here was assuredly what he needed. But one pound
five? Who was there behind the sea-wall that could rise to
such prices? Possibly it was here that Mr. Flippance had got
his wedding equipment. She returned sadly to her cart, not
even noticing that all these fashionable pictures were simply cut
out of the catalogue of the great Moses &amp; Son, London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road now led again through great grass-lands under
shimmering clouds floating in a spacious blue, and with gentle
slopes and hillocks, though little streams had replaced the
broad ditches. There were rabbits taking the air that showed
white scuts at the approach of Nip. Far to the right she left
the saltings with their grazing cattle, but she could still see them
from her driving-board, and the marshes stretched, humped and
brown and infinitely interstreaked, a mud-maze with purple
herbage and motley sea-birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly there was a thunder and clatter behind her,
and she pulled her horse mechanically to the left to avoid a
coach, not realizing till it slowed down that this was the “Flynt
Flyer’s” day for the district. Her heart beat fast, almost
painfully, and she went scarlet with the thought that Will would
think she had come purposely on his track. Why, oh why, had
she just chosen that day? There was no turning to be seen and
desperately she steered Methusalem’s nose towards a farm-gate,
prepared to trespass, but it proved to be only a “lift” for
wagons, opened by raising the rail from its slots, a feat which
Methusalem’s nose could not achieve. She leaped down and
tried to pull it up herself, but her fingers were trembling, and in
an instant Will was at her side, hat gracefully in hand, the rail
lifted up, and the gate held aside for her passing. Blushing still
more furiously under the gaze of the coach passengers, she led
Methusalem through, and as she passed she said with a sweet
smile: “Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was all the audience heard or saw, but what was really
said and substantially understood by both principals was:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Will</span>: “Oh, my dear Jinny, how pretty and kissable you look
in that becoming new bonnet, and isn’t it silly to be trying to
compete with me along this road, when, though you get business
from goodness knows who, you can’t even keep your old customers
on your own route? You haven’t got the tiniest parcel,
I see, nor any hope of one. Really you would do better to
accept my offer of a partnership, or better still to get off the roads
altogether, for the winter is going to be a hard one, and perhaps
if we dropped our silly sullen silence and began to find out each
other’s good points again, who knows but what we might come
to another sort of partnership? Anyhow I am delighted to
open this lift for you, but what the devil you are going to do in
a field just being ploughed is what I shall watch with amusement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Jinny</span>: “You perfectly unbearable Mr. Flynt! How mean
of you to come spying into my empty cart! If you want to
know, I am not out on business to-day at all, it’s a little friendly
call I am making on the farmer. I haven’t, like you, to work
all the week round to scrape together enough to feed my horses.
Two days a week keeps me in luxury—ay, and Gran’fer too. And
don’t pretend to be so gay and happy—I know what a grumpy,
runty chap you are at home, and how you’re still hankering after
that Blanche Jones who has thrown you away like an old shoe.
Or if it’s my refusal to be partners with you that’s rankling, and
you are even thinking after all of a closer partnership, then all
I can say is, you must be the village idiot if you fancy I’ll put
up with Blanche’s leavings. Don’t imagine that silly old coach
with the silly wanty-hook and skewers painted on it is very
attractive to <span class='it'>me</span>. Why, if you were to come to me in a coach
of gold like the Lord Mayor of London, with six milk-white
steeds spruced up with flowers and ribbons like Methusalem on
May Day, and say: ‘I love you, Jinny, come and sit in silks
and diamonds on my box-seat,’ I should up with my horn and
blow a blast of scorn, for I hate and despise you, and how dare
you come ogling me before all the coach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still retaining her sweet smile, Jinny gazed at the shirt-sleeved
ploughmen, who though vaguely astonished at the
invasion of their field, continued their stolid operations. Jinny
arrested her cart to watch with equal stolidity the white whirls
and long lines of fluttering gulls that followed the slow-moving
ploughs, with such a twittering and circling and looking so
beautiful over the reddish earth and under the blue sky. There
was beauty, too, she felt, in the youth who from his white basket
sprinkled seeds with a graceful motion, and when he smiled at
her, she did not hesitate to remark in her sweetest tone on the
rainy autumn, spinning out the hygrometric conversation till
Will felt it almost a flirtation. Fuming and fumbling with the
top rail, he took as much time as possible to readjust it in its
slots. But in this game of patience he knew he must be beaten:
however amusedly he might pretend to watch her pretences, his
passengers would compel him to go on, and so, in no amused
state of mind, at a moment when the gulls as by a magic clearance
disappeared to a bird, he followed their example. When the
whirlwind of his passing had died in the distance, Jinny came
back again through the lift, with the feeling that Methusalem
must think her a fool, and wondering if he were not right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after, she fell in with a carter who was going her way
with sacks of flour for his master, and as they jogged along,
conversing pleasantly, after the failure of his attempt to chaff
and flirt, she was surprised to learn that he had till recently
plied as a carrier on this very road, but had been ousted by the
“Flynt Flyer.” It had never occurred to her that there were
other victims, but as he went on to denounce Will, she found
herself defending the rights of competition and pointing out
the service the coach rendered to the neighbourhood, and the
carter fell back upon another grievance about which he was even
more embittered. On one of his last journeys a man he had
carried from the Creek had got off without paying, and he had
foolishly let him go, thinking he was “a Brandy Hole chap”
and would be returning by the same vehicle. But he had
vanished from his ken. “Oi thought he was a Brandy Hole
chap,” he kept repeating plaintively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was glad to shed him at “The Jolly Bargee,” a small inn
with a sanded tap-room and no visible taps, where, amid a company
she saw already gathered over frothing mugs, he would doubtless
bewail the competition of the coach and the trickery of the fare
he had taken for “a Brandy Hole chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noon was tolling from the square church-tower when Jinny
espied again her treasured picture of it, rising from a harmony
of golden ricks and lichen-spotted tiles, just as on that happy,
enchanted day when she had journeyed to the funeral of her
mother’s Aunt Susannah. How quickly one came—she thought
with pleased astonishment—free of the detours and delays of
custom, or the pretence thereof! There would be ample time to
visit the grave of her father and mother before going on to the
Watch Vessel, especially as it was thus on her way. But,
remembering with a sad smile the dispute as to whether her
grandfather could go to his sister’s funeral in his cart, she
took care to draw up her shabby vehicle in a nook beyond the
lych-gate. Nip had vanished—like the “Brandy Hole chap”—she
found; probably he was also at “The Jolly Bargee.” Leaving
Methusalem to his well-earned if not well-filled nose-bag, she
returned to the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The monkey-trees and weeping willows were unchanged,
though in the path leading to the church-porch there was an
avenue of young rose-bushes which she did not remember, and
screened by them, to the right, a freshly dug grave which made
her shudder. She hastened towards the crumbling tower—still
more crumbled now—which her memory connected with the
sacred spot. The blackberry-bushes still swathed it, though
they were now stripped of their fruit, and in its shadow she found
again, not without surprise, the familiar stone, the object of so
much whimsical wrangling. Still Roger Boldero lay “safely
neaped in Christ.” She was almost certain that her grandfather
had sent a couple of pounds to Commander Dap to have the
stone changed, since the inscription, it appeared, could not well
be emended otherwise. Yes, surely he had ordered that
“neaped” should be turned into “asleep,” for she remembered
counting the letters and rejoicing to find them the same in
number. But on the whole she was pleased the word had not
been changed: her Angel-Mother had wanted it, she remembered,
in memory of her happiness with Roger Boldero. As she stood
there, musing on these two, feeling her mother’s soft cheek
against hers and recalling that smoke-reeking, hairier, burlier, yet
somehow more shadowy figure, many pictures flashed and
waned, and most vividly of all came the vision of her grandfather’s
strong shoulder supporting the coffin, and the kindly
old Commander leading her off stealthily to this very spot, and
she heard the death-bell tolling again with its long solemn
pauses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then suddenly with a queer little thrill she awoke to the
fact that the death-bell <span class='it'>was</span> tolling, that a company in black <span class='it'>was</span>
bearing a coffin. She moved farther behind the tower, she was
not in black, and felt almost an interloper. Presently there
came from the rose-bushes the sonorous voice of a clergyman
intoning the great words. She did not want to be delayed
further, nor did she want to pass by the grief-stricken group,
which consisted—she saw as she peeped from her hiding-place—of
half a dozen men and women, all elderly and all weeping: with
a small band of sailors in the background, whose left arms bore
black silk handkerchiefs tied in a bow. She looked around for
another way out of the churchyard, and finding a side gate
escaped almost happily, jumped on her cart, and drove off
towards the shore, thinking pleasantly of the genial little Dap
and the dinner she would not be too late for; a meal which now,
after this long drive, began to seem the paramount consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The village rose russet from the trees, and she curved round
exquisite corners of white cottages with Christmas roses in their
gardens, and presently she came out by the grass-covered sea-wall.
She hardly saw the sordidness of the shore—-the litter of
pigs, poultry, boats, sheds, barrels—so great a seascape burst
upon her, broken by a long narrow island, that added subtle
shades and hazes to the far-spreading shimmer and fantasy, the
water glinting and moving, dotted with red-sailed smacks and
barges. Even the slimy posts that stuck up from it near the
shore had a romantic air, being young tree-trunks that still
stretched odd limbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all this glory faded into nothingness when, catching sight
of the Watch Vessel moored on the “hard” of gravel, at the
place where she had first patted Methusalem, she saw that the
flag was at half-mast. She scarcely needed to make the inquiry:
the flag, the funeral, the nautical handkerchiefs, all rushed into
a black unity. Dear old Commander Dap was dead.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A perverse imp kept telling her that the funeral meats would
be unusually abundant. But she had no heart to board the
Watch Vessel, to encounter these unknown fellow-mourners.
She wanted to mourn in solitude. And her quest had failed.
The last hope for her grandfather had been extinguished—Dap
had followed Sidrach—and the best thing to do was to get home
as quickly as poor Methusalem could manage it. He should
rest, not here where she might meet the returning Daps and
perhaps be recognized through Daniel Quarles’s cart, but when
they got to “The Jolly Bargee,” where she must have a bit of
bread and cheese brought out to her. Yet she could not tear
herself away from this squalid, sublime waterside, and driving
along the cart-route behind the sea-wall to a safe distance, she
got out near a little wooden pier and walked on the rough earth
of the sea-wall, which was luxuriant with pigweed and sea-beet,
strewn with wisps of hay and straw from passing carts, and
covered with dead little white-shelled crabs. There was something
akin to her mood in the pleasant pain of the acrid mud-smell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At “The Jolly Bargee” she was jarred by the slow easy
laughter from the tap-room—the trickery of the “Brandy Hole
chap” was still under facetious debate. Before her set face, the
gorged Nip, rejoining her at the inn-door with conscious drooping
tail, turned on his back and grovelled guiltily: but she ignored
his abasement, and having gulped down her snack of bread and
cheese—an unwelcome and unforeseen expense—drove on with
the same brooding air. She was dazed by the wonder and
pathos of the little Commander’s death, the whole genial breathing
mass become as insensitive as his glass eye: would he get
that back at the Resurrection, she pondered, or would there be
his original eye? Thence she passed to the thought of the dead
Sidrach, the large handsome man of a hundred and five, strong
as a bull of Bashan, whom she was supposed to be visiting, and
she wondered dully what report of him she should bring back to
her grandfather. Abandoning herself as usual to Methusalem’s
guidance in this deep brooding, she discovered after an hour or
so that in his ignorance of these roads he had gone miles out of
their way, down Smugglers’ Lane, and when after half an hour
of readjustment she had got on the right homeward road, her
own subconscious gravitation to the waterside took her back to
it. And while she gave Methusalem a rest here, the white moon
and the early November sunset began to brood over the mud-flats,
transfiguring them with strange scintillant gold, and Jinny
felt a divine lesson in the transfiguration, and the solemn voice
of the clergyman echoed in her ears: “I am the Resurrection
and the Life.” Doubtless the Commander was already in
communion with the Angel-Mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The problem of Sidrach was still unsolved when the feeding-field
she had seen preparing in the morning loomed again on
her vision like a reminder of the urgency of that question. She
envied Master Peartree’s sheep munching so imperturbably in
their hurdles while she had been going through all these emotions
and perplexities. With their black noses and feet they looked,
she thought, as though they had been drinking from a pool of
ink, and her thoughts wandered again from her problem, and
she let Methusalem drink from a pool of water. Though it was
only four o’clock, the moon had turned a pale ochre and was
shining full and high in the heavens, its continents clearly
showing. There was no sound save the chewing of the sheep,
the gulping of her horse, the wistful tinkling of a wether’s bell,
and from afar the fainter clanging of a cow-bell. Even Nip,
feeling unforgiven, was subdued. Life was beautiful after all,
she felt, as she watched the great splashes of sunset below the
moon, the glimmering rose-tint on the horizon, the glint upon
the pool, the tangle of magical gold in the branches. Somehow
a way would be opened for her through this network of mendacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But by the time she got to her door, the Common was covered
again with a grey mist, just oozing rain, and Blackwater Hall
was a place of shrouded terrors. No light was showing through
the shutters or through the chinks in door or window, and she
had a sudden clammy intuition that her grandfather had solved
her problem for her by the simple process of dying like Sidrach
and the Commander. Silent and weird lay thatch and whitewash
under the moon. She hammered at the house-door and
then at the shutters, her heart getting colder and colder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tried the door again, then hearing Nip barking mysteriously
from within, she went round to the kitchen-door. To her joy and
amazement it was wide open, and a ray of moonlight resting on
a little pool of beer on the brick floor showed that the tap of the
beer-barrel which was kept there was dribbling. Even in that
anxious moment her economical instinct prevailed, and as she
was tightening the tap, there permeated through the living-room
door a heavenly snore—no lesser adjective could convey the
relief it brought. With a bound she was up the couple of stone
steps and, unlatching the door, she sent a faint blue glimmer
from the kitchen into the shuttered darkness, that was relieved
only by the flicker of an expiring lamp and a last spark from a
dying log. In that dim discord of lights she saw her grandfather’s
head on the thumb-holed tray, his hair and beard a dull
grey spread, dividing a darker jug from two beery glasses. The
absence of his Bible-pillow seemed symbolic of his degradation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who had been with him? she wondered. What boon companion
had tempted him from his habitual moderation? She could not
imagine. She shook him to awaken him, and lifted up his head.
But it fell back in a stupor, and under the draught from the
kitchen-door the lamp-flicker went out. She groped about,
replenishing the lamp and trying to light it with a spill from the
fire, but the greying log only charred the paper. She fumbled
in vain among the china shepherdesses on the mantelpiece for
her flint and the iron and steel gauntlet, and going out to get her
lighting-up matches from her cart, she overturned the other arm-chair
that stood in a novel situation at the table—probably the
guest had drawn it up there. But the noise left the Gaffer’s
snore unweakened. Well, at any rate he had solved her problem—at
least for the moment—she thought bitterly, as she groped
her way back to the glimmering grate. But even the chemical
matches would not light, whether by friction or when placed on
the charred log: evidently the long damp had impaired them,
and they even snapped under her fingers. How lucky it was
one need not rely on such new-fangled gewgaws, she thought
when—by a happy inspiration—she found the solid steel and
stone with the tinder-box in the Gaffer’s pockets; and soon the
lamp was lit and the fire glowing ruddily under the bellows.
Then she made herself some kettle-broth (hot water with bread
soaked in it), which, sipped before the fire, was almost as cheering
as the blazing logs, and resisting the temptation to cook one of
the bloaters, she fed the still subdued Nip from the bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was cosily couched in his basket, and with a last summoning
of her spent energies, she had rubbed down Methusalem,
she tried to fold her third charge, but the old man still snored
steadily, and when she sought again to raise his head from the tray,
he swore inarticulately in his sleep, and she was too worn out to
persist or even to remove the tray and glasses. She wanted to
sleep herself, after all these emotions and the long day in the
air, and her cracked mirror showed her a drawn face that yawned
and closed weary eyes against itself. But it now occurred to
her that she could not get to bed with Gran’fer in the room, she
must sleep in an arm-chair or on the settle, or stretched on
the floor with the cushion for pillow. But the floor through
her early start was unswept, the settle was too narrow, and the
chair soon got so hard that after a last attempt to rouse the
sleeper, she put an old cloak over his shoulders, a stout log on
the fire, turned out the lamp—setting her shadow leaping monstrously—and
dragged herself up the dark, fusty staircase to his
room, where she let herself fall dressed on his bed. She did not
dare get between the sheets, for fear he might wake up in the
night and come up to bed. Lying there, muttering the prayers
she was too tired to kneel for, she had an underthought that
Providence was giving her a hint: assuredly in the coming
winter nights she must leave him in the room that was warmed
all day by the fire, exchanging bedrooms, though not for the
reason he had once suggested—a reason that made her last
conscious thought a shame-faced memory. But her next thought
was one of pleasant wonder—sunshine splashing the whitewashed
sloping walls through the undrawn blind of a little
lattice. What was this strange spacious room? How came she
there in her clothes? Then memory resurged, and feeling she
had slept dangerously long, she sprang up, unhooked the casement,
and drew a deep breath of fresh air, as she gazed on this
unfamiliar morning view of the Common and the hoar-frosted
fields, dazzling her eye with floating colour-specks from the sun
that cut redly through the foliage of a fir-tree. Particularly she
relished the silver rim of the Brad now descried on the horizon.
It made her feel sickish to descend from that space and freshness
to the dark, airless, shuttered room with its musty, beery smell
and its all-pervading snore. Swiftly she threw open the shutters
and the casement, and let the light and air stream in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chill draught and the noise she made seemed to rouse the
Gaffer at last, for as she was returning from the kitchen with
some kindlings for the fire in her apron, he opened his eyes with
a start and stared at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Sidrach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was taken aback: she had not yet prepared her story.
Indeed the waking in the big attic and the puzzle of his condition
had driven her own problem out of her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sidrach?” she murmured. Should she out with his death
and be done with it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, he got riled ’cause Oi wouldn’t let him smoke. Where’s
he got to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now her turn to stare at him. “Nonsense, Gran’fer,”
she said gently, “that’s a dream you’ve been having.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mebbe.” He blinked in the sunlight, mystified. Suddenly
his face darkened. “Why do ye tell me lies agen? There’s his
tumbler!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed to one of the beery glasses she had left still standing.
Commonplace as the glass looked with its lees, she was
glad he had not pointed at it the evening before in the weird
moonlight with her brain full of the poor dead Dap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell me!” she said in a voice she tried in vain to make
stern. “It wasn’t Sidrach that was drinking with you. Who
<span class='it'>was</span> it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Sidrach, Oi’m tellin’ ye,” he protested. “Oi put out
his beer with his tumbler and his chair to be ready soon as ye
brought him back, he bein’ a rare one for his liquor. But the
hours passed slow as a funeral crawl, it got owl-light and you
not back, ne yet a rumble of your cart upon the road, so at last
molloncholy-like Oi lights the lamp and makes a roaring fire
and drinks by myself, and then Oi locks and bolts up and
stoops down to put on another log, and when Oi looks up,
there he sets in his chair in his best Sunday smock, all clean and
white.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thrilled again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could he get in, if you’d locked up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Oi says to him. ‘Good Lord, Sidrach,’ Oi says,
‘how did you get here?’ ‘Come in the coach from Che’msford,’
says he. ‘The coach,’ says Oi, wexed, ‘ye didn’t want to back up
the jackanips what’s come competitioning here, and Jinny gone
to fetch ye, too. But how did ye get through the door?’ Oi says.
‘You draw me some beer, Danny,’ says he. ‘For Oi count ye’ve
finished the jug.’ So Oi goos to the kitchen with the jug, and
there sure enough stands the door wide open—happen Oi hadn’t
shut it good tightly—and there passin’ along the road by the
Common Oi catches sight of the coach, lookin’ all black in the
dusk and glidin’ away wery quiet, same as ashamed to be in
our cart-racks. ‘You pirate thief,’ Oi says, shakin’ my fist at
the driver, ‘ye’ll never come into this house save on your hands
and knees.’ But when Oi goos back with my jug brimmin’ over,
Sidrach warn’t there. ‘Sidrach!’ Oi calls, ‘Sidrach!’ No answer.
Oi goos about beat out and crazy ’twixt here and the kitchen
and then the clock strikes, and that remembers me to look in the
tother room, and there Oi hears him chucklin’ to hisself in one
of they big empty boxes ye left at home this marnin’. ‘Out ye
come,’ says Oi, laughin’ too, for he was allus up to his pranks,
was Sid. ‘And Oi’m proper glad to see you, old chap,’ Oi says.
With that he comes out of his box, with a little o’ the dust on
his white smock, and he hugs and coases me—wery cowld his
hands and face was from the long jarney—and Oi drinks his
health and he drinks mine, and we clinks they glasses together
and has rare sport gammickin’ of the times when Oi was in my
twenties and he taken me to see the cock-fightin’ and that old
Christmas Day his dog won the silver spoon in the bear-baitin’ at
‘The Black Sheep,’ and Oi told him as Annie were free now but
seein’ as he was come to stay, Oi dedn’t want nobody else and he
needn’t be afeared he’d be tarned out ef Oi died, bein’ as Oi’d
left the house to him by will and testament. ‘Little Danny,’ says
he, ‘you’re a forthright brother, but no fear o’ the poorhouse for
neither on us, for Oi was born with that silver spoon in my
mouth, and Oi’ve got a stockin’ chock-full o’ gold,’ and he shows
me it, hunderds of spade guineas, each with the head of Gearge III,
fit to warm the cockles of your heart, and we clinked glasses agen
and sang three-times-three, merry as grigs, and then the devil
possesses him to pull out his pipe and baccar. ‘No, ye don’t,’
says Oi, ‘not for all the gold in Babylon,’ and Oi runs to pocket
the flint and steel on the mantelpiece, and to block out the fire,
and he laughs and howds his pipe over the lamp and draws like
a demon. Oi rushes to the lamp and tarns it out and then back
to the fire, but aldoe that give a goodish light, Sidrach, he warn’t
there no more.” He was almost blubbering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how did he look?” said Jinny, whose kindlings had long
since slid from her apron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hansum bonkka man, Oi keep tellin’ ye. Ain’t ye seen
him nowhere? Where’s he got to? Just there he sat singin’
with his great old woice:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The quavering melody ended with a big sneeze, and Jinny,
fearing the brothers would indeed be reunited, rushed to close
the window and light the fire. Though she felt confusedly that
her grandfather, waiting for Sidrach, and drinking too freely in
his melancholy, had probably dreamed it all, she was not sure
that he had not really seen Sidrach’s ghost. How else would
the flint and steel have got into his pocket? In any case she
was reminded that her secret was not safe. In concealing a
death one forgot to reckon with the ghost, and Sidrach’s might
at any time divulge it suddenly to his brother, even if the present
visitation was only a dream. Dap’s ghost, too, was another possibility
that must be taken into account. “I’ll tell you where
Sidrach’s got to,” she said desperately, as a yellow flame leapt up,
“he’s got to heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To heaven?” repeated the old man vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To heaven!” she said inexorably. “He hasn’t been in
Chelmsford for weeks. He was very old, you see, a hundred
and five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gaffer began to tremble. “Ye don’t really mean Sidrach’s
gone to heaven?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded her head sadly. “He fell down,” she explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fell down to heaven?” he asked dazedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His body fell downstairs—his soul went up to God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he come downstairs agen last night, dear Sidrach,” he
said solemnly; “he come to have a glass and a gammick with his
little brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was not prepared to deny it, and though the idea jarred,
it was after all difficult to see snoring senectitude with the
poetry attaching to Angel-Mothers. She removed the dirty
glasses silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where’s his stockin’ o’ gold?” he inquired suddenly.
“Why didn’t ye bring back that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There wasn’t any,” she said gently. “He died poorish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve stole it,” he cried. “They’ve robbed me. ’Twas
me he meant it for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—all he left was used up in the funeral.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, they ain’t satisfied with carts nowadays,” he commented
bitterly. “Like that doddy little Dap. Did you goo to the
churchyard to see the grave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she replied unflinchingly, sustained by the verbal
accuracy. “I’ve got you a bloater for breakfast,” she added
cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the cowld chill he caught as a cad, gatherin’ eggs on
the ma’shes,” he said musingly. “Ague they calls it—never got
over it. And tramped with his pack-horses in all weathers. And
rollin’ about here and there and everywheres. ‘You’ll never
make old bones, Sid,’ Oi says to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hundred and five is pretty old, Gran’fer,” Jinny reminded
him. “King David only says seventy, that’s exactly one and a
half lives your brother had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the Book,” he said brokenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With trembling hands she brought the great Family Bible he
had inherited with the house. But his object seemed to be
neither verification of the text nor prayerful reading, for he
next asked for pen and ink, and then having ascertained the
exact date of Sidrach’s death, he adjusted his spectacles and
chronicled it with a quavering quill opposite Sidrach’s birth-date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone to heaven,” he said. “That’s more than some
folks’ll do—even on their hands and knees. Do ye warm my
beer for me this marnin’, dearie, for Oi fare to be cowld and
lonely in my innards, and Oi’d fain smoke a pipe myself, same as
Oi hadn’t promised the old man o’ God.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The year ended gloomily for Jinny. December was cold. In
the mornings the fields looked almost snowy with hoar-frost, but
the actual snow did not come till near Christmas. Her grandfather
refused to be moved from his bedroom—one was safer from
thieves up there, he now urged—so a fire upstairs every evening
was added to her work. But the monotony of existence and of
the struggle therefor was broken by two letters and an episode,
albeit all interconnected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both letters were from Toby, the naval gunner, Dap’s eldest
son, and the one for her grandfather was enclosed in hers, as
Toby was not sure the old gentleman was still alive, one of his
sisters having heard that there was a piece in the paper about
his death at the age of a hundred and five. He had only found
her own address after the funeral, he wrote, a packet of letters
from her having come to hand in the clearing up. For although
his poor father with his last breath had asked that his telescope
be given to little Jinny Boldero as a token of love and remembrance,
he had died without telling them where to send it. It
would now be forwarded in due course. For two months he
had borne much pain with Christian resignation, she learnt with
sorrow and respect. The other letter, addressed “Mr. Daniel
Quarles,” she had no option but to hand over, but did so with
anxiety, for she had not yet broken the news of Dap’s death, and
whether he received it with regret or with unchristian satisfaction,
it would assuredly agitate him. As she watched him open it,
she saw a piece of paper flutter from it, and she caught it in
its fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s mine!” he cried, snatching it from her fingers. “Pay
the person naimed——” he read out dazedly. “What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That must be a money order,” she explained, though with
no less surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A money order?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve seen post-office orders, surely,” she said, not realizing
that they had only become common a decade ago with the
introduction of penny postage, and that nobody—not even his
children—had ever sent him one before. “ ’Tis a way of sending
money—you can send as much as two pounds for threepence.
How much is yours for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overlaid memories of his late eighties struggled to the surface.
“Oh, ay,” he said, not answering her. “That was a blow for
the carriers—that and the penny post. Folks began to write
to the shops; dedn’t matter so much here, but the Che’msford
carriers complained bitter as the tradesmen sent out their own
carts with the goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how much is it for?” repeated Jinny impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He studied it afresh, holding it away from her like a dog with
its paw on a bone. “Three pound!” he announced with rapturous
defiance. “Ye took away my foiver. But this be for the person
naimed on the enwelope, and that’s Daniel Quarles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s it for?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s for me,” he said conclusively, and was going up to his
room like a magpie with its treasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but read the letter,” she urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He consented to sit down and study it. “Good God!” he
blubbered soon. “Poor Dap’s dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead?” echoed Jinny mendaciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You read it for yourself, dearie. An awful pity, a man in
the prime of life. ’Tis from his boy in the Navy as he ast to
send me three pounds what he owed me. That was wunnerful
honest of him, to remember, seein’ as Oi don’t, aldoe Oi count the
Lord put it into his heart, knowin’ Oi wanted money terrible
bad. But Oi allus felt he was a good chap underneath: ’twarn’t
his fault he had a glass eye. That made him look at the nose,
like, and git frownin’ and quarrelsome. Three pound! That’s
a good nest-egg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Jinny, glad the death was passing off so peacefully,
“and he’s sending me his telescope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He don’t say that,” he said, peering at the letter again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned red. “I had a line too—didn’t you notice yours
had no stamp? I’ll change your order for you at the post office,”
she went on hurriedly. Mentally she had worked out that two
of the pounds represented the price of the new gravestone the
Commander had never purchased, and the third his idea of
interest for all these years. Doubtless he had been too tactful
to send them back in his lifetime. Anyhow she agreed with her
grandfather that it was really all the Lord’s doing, for nothing
could be timelier. Even her poultry was now being steadily
sacrificed, and this great sum would get her beautifully over
Christmas and New Year and start that with a handsome balance
in hand. But she had counted without her grandfather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t!” The Gaffer’s hand closed grimly on the
precious paper. “That’s a nest-egg, Oi’m tellin’ ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what are you going to do with it?” she inquired in
distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s for Annie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Skindle’s mother! But he’s rich as rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He don’t never buy her nawthen. He come here and told
me sow out of his own mouth, the hunks. Oi had to pay for her
packet o’ hairpins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyhow she’ll have her Christmas dinner, and that’s
more than you’re sure of,” she risked threatening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got the telescope, hain’t ye?” he urged uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t sell that. That’s for remembrance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye can remember him without a telescope. And ef he had
his faults, ’tain’t for you to remember ’em, seein’ as ye’d never
a-bin here at all ef he’d done his duty by Emma and King Gearge.
But Oi reckon he couldn’t see everythink with that glass eye,
and Oi ought to ha’ carried silks and brandy myself ’stead o’
parcels and culch. Did, Oi’d a-got a stockin’ like Sidrach’s and
not had to deny myself bite and sup for your sake.” And he
hobbled stairwards, the post-office order clutched in his skeleton
claw. “Do ye write to Dap’s buoy-oy and thank him for payin’ his
dues, and say as Oi hope he won’t put no fooleries on his father’s
stone, and he’d best copy what Oi had put on your father’s and
mother’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny duly wrote, if not in these terms. But when the telescope
came, she felt anything but thankful. For, welcome as
it was in itself, it came by the coach. She had been too
distraught to foresee this, though she recognized that it was
the natural way. And apart from the sting to her own pride,
it agitated her grandfather profoundly. He had been nodding
at the hearth, but the clamour of the coach aroused
him, and ere she could get to the door he had sprung up with
an oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let him over my doorstep!” he cried, pursuing her.
“He’s got to come in on his hands and knees.” He jostled her
aside and seized the bolt, but his hand trembled so, he could not
shoot it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can he crawl in, if you bolt the door?” she said tactfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was staggered: the possibility of the opposition obstinacy
relaxing had never even occurred to him. Recovering, he urged
that the enemy would try to rush over the sill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fear, Gran’fer. He’ll never cross our threshold unless
you carry him in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke with unconscious admiration of Will’s tenacity.
Indeed the image of the young man crawling to her grandfather
or even to herself would have been repellent, had it been really
conceivable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carry him in!” the Gaffer laughed explosively, and that
burst of derision made him almost good-humoured. He let
himself be pushed gently towards the inner room, while Jinny,
with her pulse at gallop, opened the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tension and friction of nerves proved sheer waste. The
long narrow parcel was brought to the door by the hobbledehoy
guard, and the driver remained, imperturbably important, on his
box, looking almost as massive as an old stager in his new, caped
greatcoat and coloured muffler, though the face under the broad-brimmed
festively sprigged hat was very different from the
mottled malt-soused visages of the coaching breed. It seemed
but an idle glance that Jinny cast at it, or at the Christmas
congestion of the coach, overflowing with passengers and literal
Christmas boxes, and with hares pendent even from the driver’s
seat. Nevertheless, as ever when they met, long invisible
messages passed between Jinny and Will, and not all her defiance
could disguise her humiliation at this second triumph of the
coach, coming as it did when the fortunes of the cart were at
their blackest. For the Gaffer refused sullenly to part with his
piece of paper—she did not even know where he had hidden it—and
with Uncle Lilliwhyte too poorly to forage for her, she was
almost tempted to apply for the Christmas doles that were by
ancient bequest more abundant at Mr. Fallow’s church than applicants
for them. But her instinct of “uprightness” saved her:
better that the last of her poultry should be sacrificed for the
sacred repletions of the season. She did indeed dally with the
notion of keeping Christmas not with, but from, her grandfather—possibly
his failing memory might for once prove an advantage—but
she had a feeling that apart from the profanity of ignoring
it, the festival was too ingrained in the natural order to be overlooked,
for did not Christmas mark the pause in the year, when
with the crops in the ground and the little wheat-blades safely
tucked under the snow, and the beer brewed and the pigs killed
and salted, the whole world rests and draws happy frosted
breath? No, the old man’s instinct would surely trip her up, if
she tried to run Christmas as an ordinary day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She might, of course, as he had originally suggested, sell or
at least pawn her telescope, but even if she could have brought
herself to that, she could not have got it away from him, for he
had annexed it from the first moment and sat peering out of it
from the vantage-point of his bedroom lattice. He was at his
spy-glass the moment he woke, enchanted when he could descry
people or incidents far-off—it was as if his long seclusion from
the outer world was over—and he would call out like a child
and tell Jinny what he had seen. Sometimes it was Master
Peartree and his dog, sometimes Bidlake ferrying on the Brad or
a couple seeking warmth in a cold lane; now a woodman cutting
holly branches with his billhook, anon Bundock bowed by his
bag or Mott with his fishing-rod, and once he cried out he could
see Annie coming out of Beacon Chimneys, though Jinny suspected
that the tall figure with the “wunnerful fine buzzom”
was really Farmer Gale’s new wife. Particularly protected did
her grandfather now feel against thieves, whose stealthy advent
he would henceforward detect from afar. Delighted as she was
in her turn with the new toy that kept him happy even on a
reduced diet, she had to keep his fire going all day now, and to
be up and down closing the window through which he <span class='it'>would</span>
stick the telescope. Sometimes he directed his tube heaven-ward,
though not for astronomical purposes. “Happen Oi’ll see
Sidrach coming down for a gossip,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before Christmas he informed her he had decided that the
right thing to do with the nest-egg was to purchase Sidrach a
gravestone with it, and he instructed her to write a letter of
inquiry to Babylon. But although this seemed to her a more
logical use of it than he knew, she disregarded his instruction.
The nest-egg was too precious. The time might come when he
would ask for bread, and was she to give him a stone?</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Neglected on the coast in favour of New Year, Christmas was
celebrated in the inland valley of the Brad with the conventional
accessories, and every Christmas the mummers had been wont
to attend on the Master of Blackwater Hall; as well as the waits.
Jinny with no coin to offer to either, the last of her poultry doomed
for the Christmas dinner, and Uncle Lilliwhyte also on her
hands, had this year to beg both companies to refrain, alleging
her grandfather was too ill. The weather was seasonable, the
robin hopped as picturesquely on the snow as on the Christmas
card Jinny had enclosed with her thanksgiving letter to Gunner
Dap. The cottage, prankt with its holly and mistletoe, had a
fairylike air—everything was perfect, even to the Christmas
pudding. But only Nip and Methusalem were happy. To the
Gaffer the breach of an immemorial tradition gave a troubling
sense of void.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the waits? Where’s Father Chris’mus? Where’s
St. Gearge?” he kept saying peevishly. Jinny put him off with
vague replies or none. Once he alarmed her by asking suddenly:
“Where’s the Doctor?” She was reassured when he began
spouting:</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed on to imagine himself as St. George, and seizing the

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t we a-gooin’ to see the mummers?” he inquired angrily

<p class='pindent'>“But they’re gooin’ around to other folk!” he protested.
“Oi seen ’em through my glass!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then you <span class='it'>have</span> seen them,” she said still more feebly.
Inwardly she wondered if he had detected herself, on her way
to church, carrying off some Christmas dinner to Uncle Lilliwhyte’s
hut. The telescope was a new terror added to life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had wanted to invite the prop of her larder to take his
Christmas dinner with them, but her grandfather refused violently
to sit down with such a “ragamuffin.” His sense of caste was
acute, and as Jinny’s sense of smell was equally acute, she would
not have persisted, even had renewed rheumatism not confined
the ancient to his hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day after Christmas that year was Friday, and after the
comparative festivity of the holiday it required no small force
of will to go round uselessly in the north wind, when one day a
week would have more than sufficed for such odd commissions
as still came her way. The snow had fallen thicker in the night,
and robins, starlings, finches, blackbirds, little blue-tits (pick-cheeses
she called them), and other breakfastless birds had all
been tapping at her window for crumbs. But the remains of
the feast made a good meal for her grandfather and he was in
the best of humours, praising the acting of the mummers, which
he did not now remember he had not seen this Christmas, and
remarking upon the “wunnerful fine woice” of old Ravens’
grandson among the waits. Apparently his memories of other
years had fused together into an illusion concerning the day
before. As Jinny set out, she found herself wishing he would
forget his quarrel with Will. Not, of course, that she could
forget hers!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were grey snow-clouds in the sky, and as she ploughed
past the sheepfolds, scarring the purity of the road with her
cart-tracks, she beheld patriarchal sheep, standing almost silent
with round, snow-white beards: only a green shoot peeped here
and there from the speckless white expanse. Methusalem’s
muffled footsteps gave her a sense of dream, and, when the wind
was not in her face, she watched her breath rising white in the
air with some strange sense of exhaling her soul. But beneath
this mystic daze went an undercurrent of wonder as to how she
could meet the New Year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returned from her round—and she was glad, having shown
herself and got her meal, to creep home under cover of the early
darkness—she half expected to find the Gaffer as ill as she had
feigned, but though he was still peering out into the night, there
was no sign he was in the grip of the cold; on the contrary he
seemed to have found fresh strength and brightness, whether from
the nest-egg or this renewed ocular intercourse with his world.
“Oi seen you all along the road,” he chuckled. In this new
mood she was easily able to persuade him to exchange a goat
for Methusalem’s provender. He would not part with his three
pounds, but they gave him a sense of security, almost of gaiety.
Indeed their existence made as wonderful a difference to herself
as to him. Hidden away though the money order was, she felt
the old man would be forced to produce it if ever hunger got too
keen, and so the knowledge of it sustained her as the proximity
of a boat sustains a swimmer. It was scarcely a paradox that
without its assistance she could not have got through the
first month of the New Year. For January brought the “hard
winter” foretold by the sloes. Outwardly it was a bright
world enough, with children skating on the ponds and ditches:
indeed the frost brought out a veritable flamboyance of colour
in the animal creation, and at one of her moments of despair
when she had humbled herself in vain to offer lace to the new
Mrs. Gale, Jinny was redeemed by the motley pomp of the cocks
shining on the farmyard straw, and the glowing hues of the
calves that bestrode it with them, all overbrooded by the ancient
mellow thatch. Her heart sang again with the row of chaffinches
perched on the white stone wall, and looking at the trees
silhouetted so gracefully against the sky, she decided that winter
bareness was almost more beautiful than summer opulence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she changed her mind when she watched—with a new sympathy
born of fellow-anxiety—the struggle for food among the
birds. Coots had flocked in from the coast to add to the competition
of land-species, and frozen little forms or bloody half-feathered
fragments, but especially dead starlings with lovely shades of
green and purple, pathetically imponderable when picked up, all
skin and feather—sometimes decapitated by sparrow-hawks—abounded
on the hard white roads. As she began to feel the
same grim menace brooding over her grandfather and herself,
that social unrest which reached even Bradmarsh in faint vibrations
began to take possession of her, and she arrived at a revolutionary
notion which would have horrified Farmer Gale far more
than her outrageous demand for a law that nobody should
be paid less than ten shillings a week. She actually maintained
that every man should be pensioned off by the parish on reaching
the age of ninety! But the view found no sympathy in an age
of individualism, to which the poorhouse was the supreme
humiliation. Even Uncle Lilliwhyte, who was now on the mend
again—though too weak to fend for anybody but himself—told
her to her surprise that every man ought to put by for a rainy
day. It was this slavish sluggishness of the poor that was the
real stumbling-block to reform, she thought, though remembering
Uncle Lilliwhyte’s leaky habitation, she treasured up his reply as
a humorous example of the gap between precept and practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even more unsympathetic was Mrs. Mott’s attitude. She
scoffed at the idea that every man should be pensioned off at
ninety. “Poisoned off at twenty,” was her emendation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you do your best,” Jinny laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Mott’s blue silk bodice crackled. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you sell them liquor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good liquor,” said Mrs. Mott, flushing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was only joking. But joking apart, it doesn’t do them
much good.” And Jinny thought of how even her grandfather
had fuddled himself, with or without ghostly assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I gave up my bar,” said Mrs. Mott hotly, “who would pay
the rent of our chapel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but the chapel got along before you joined,” Jinny
reminded her mildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaping up debt!” shrilled Mrs. Mott, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what’s the good of poisoning off the men?” argued
Jinny, smiling. “Where would your bar be without them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women could learn to drink,” said Mrs. Mott fiercely, “and
smoke too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the latter accomplishment seemed so comically impossible
to Jinny—who had never seen Polly over her cigar and milk—that
she burst out laughing at the image of it, and her laughter
made Mrs. Mott fiercer, and that lady said for two pins she’d
wear pink pantaloons like the Bloomerites. As Jinny did not
offer the pins, but laughed even more merrily at the new picture
presented to her imagination, relations with Mrs. Mott became
strained, and when at their next meeting Jinny sensibly remarked
that if the law really gave Mr. Mott his wife’s possessions, it was
useless going to it, all that lady’s indomitable spirit turned
against her whilom confidante. “You take his part like everybody
else,” she cried bitterly. “But don’t think I haven’t seen
him ogling you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean I’ve ogled <span class='it'>him</span>?” said Jinny, incensed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t say that, but you can’t dislike his admiration—why
else are you on his side?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not on his side—I detest him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Mott flew off at a tangent. “Then you ought to be
grateful to me for protecting you against him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was now as indignant as her hostess. “How have you
protected me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t I kept you always out of his way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is that why you’ve had me in the kitchen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny felt at once chilled and inflamed. “It’s not true,” she
cried recklessly. “When I first came to the kitchen, Mr. Mott
was still in love with you, and I only went there because you
didn’t like to show yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such reminders are unforgivable, and Jinny would probably
never again have enjoyed Mrs. Mott’s hospitality, even had she
not then and there shaken it off. It was only with an effort she
could prevent herself declaring that Mrs. Mott would have to
carry her into the kitchen before she entered it again. But when
she got out in the cold air, she felt suddenly as foolish as Will
and her grandfather had been. With starvation bearing down
on Blackwater Hall like some grim iceberg, the loss of two
full meals a week was a disaster. She was not even sure that
the courtyard as well as the kitchen would not be closed to her,
for Mrs. Mott seemed a woman without measure, whether in her
religion, her affections, her politics, or her quarrels. Possibly,
however, the poor lady overlooked her use of it, for the cart
continued to draw up there with its air of immemorial and
invincible custom. But if Jinny thus still kept up appearances,
it was with a heart that grew daily heavier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In looking back on this grim period, Jinny always regarded
the crawling up of the wounded hedgehog as marking the zero-point
in her fortunes. It was actually crawling over her doorstep
like Will in her grandfather’s imagination. What enemy
had bitten off its neck-bristles she never knew—she could only
hope it was not Nip—but catching sight of the dark, ugly gash,
she hastened to get a clean rag as well as some crumbs and goat-milk.
The poor creature allowed the wound to be dressed, and
seemed to nose among the crumbs, but it neither ate nor drank.
She packed it in straw in a little box and placed it in a warm
corner of the kitchen, instructing Nip sternly that it was tabu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caught a pig?” said the Gaffer with satisfaction, stumbling
into the middle of this lesson in the higher ethics. “That’s a
wunnerful piece o’ luck, a change from rabbits, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t eat it?” she cried in horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what else?” he asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s bread and there’s jelly,” she said, misunderstanding,
“and perhaps Uncle Lilliwhyte will be round with something—he’s
about again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t nawthen better than hedgehog,” the Gaffer said
decisively. “And ’tis years since Oi tasted one. Sidrach doted
on ’em roasted, used to catch ’em in the ditch-brambles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’ve got to cure this, not kill it,” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye don’t cure pigs that size,” he laughed happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For once Jinny failed to appreciate a joke. “It threw itself
on our protection,” she insisted. “We can’t take advantage of
it like that. Besides, it’s been bitten and might be unhealthy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was contumacious, and it was only on her undertaking
to get him a chicken for his dinner that he consented to forgo the
dainty in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To acquire this in the absence of coin involved the barter of
the remaining goats in a large and complex transaction with Miss
Gentry’s landlady, and although this set Jinny and Methusalem
up for weeks, yet since it meant the exhaustion of her last reserves,
the wounded hedgehog became to happier memory a sort of
symbol of desperation. True, there were still the telescope and
the money order, but one could not easily lay one’s hand on
them—they bristled even more fiercely than the poor hedgehog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All Jinny’s care of that confiding beast proved wasted. In
vain she renewed the dressing on its neck, in vain Nip and her
grandfather were kept off. The third morning it was found on
its back, more helpless than Uncle Lilliwhyte, with its hind paws
close together but its front paws held up apart, as though crying
for mercy. Its nose and paws came up dark brown on the
lighter spines around, the eyes were closed and almost invisible,
buried like the ears amid the bristles. The rag still adorned
its neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny gave her poor little patient a decent burial and a few
tears. “ ’Tain’t no use cryin’ over spilt milk,” the Gaffer
taunted her. “Ye’ve gone and wasted good food, and Oi count
the Lord’ll think twice afore He sends ye a present agen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gaffer was mistaken. Little Bradmarsh was about to
flow, if not with milk and honey, with hares and rabbits and
horses and sheep and haystacks and potatoes and mangolds and
even chairs, step-ladders, fences, gates, watering-pots, casks,
boxes, hurdles, hen-coops, and wheelbarrows. For after January
had ended in a crescendo of rain, wind, sleet and the heaviest
snowfall in his memory, came a diminuendo movement of sleet,
thaw, and rain, though the wind raged unabated, and after that—the
Deluge!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> floods of ’52 are still remembered in East Anglia. The
worst and most widespread were in November, but “February
Fill-Dyke” brought the more localized catastrophe in Little
Bradmarsh. The village, lying as it did along the left bank of
the Brad, was caught between two waters, the overflow of the
streams to the north that ran down silt-laden towards this bank,
and the backwash over the bank from the Brad itself, which,
already swollen by rain, and by the waters pumped into it from
the marsh-mills on its right bank, was prevented overflowing
southwards by the dyke that further protected Long Bradmarsh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Nip that brought Jinny the news, though she did not
understand its purport till the service was over. For it was to
church that he brought it. That ancient building, standing
isolated on its green knoll flaked with gravestones, had begun to
appeal to him as much as to Jinny, and despite her efforts to
dodge or shake him off, he had become a regular churchgoer.
Nobody seemed to mind his sitting in her pew or squatting by
the stove: perhaps so exiguous a congregation could not be
exigent, and in that aching void even a canine congregant was
not unwelcome. But his mistress, despite the sense she shared
with Mr. Fallow of divine glimmerings in the animal creation,
had always an uneasy feeling of indecorum, especially when Nip
snored through the sermon like a Christian, and she was congratulating
herself that the “Fifthly and Finally” had been
safely reached without him, when in he trotted—far wetter and
muddier than on the day he had plumped on Will’s knees in the
chapel. The sight of him dripping steadily along the aisle
towards the stove did not interrupt the hymn: the worshippers,
though the morning had begun with a set-back to snow, were in
no wise surprised by a return to rain. Only that Saturday
night it had rained “cats and dogs”: one dripping dog was
therefore no alarming phenomenon. They did not realize that
Nip had largely swum to church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when, at the church-door, they began to fumble with their
umbrellas, they saw with wide eyes of astonishment and dismay
that though a mere sleety drizzle misted the air, below the lych-gate
a strange expanse of waters awaited their feet. Except
for one broad finger of land pointing along the centre of a vast
yellow lake, their world was suddenly turned to water, and
Jinny had a weird wonder as to what the dead would think
could they rise and see the transformation wrought in the earthy
spot where they had laid themselves so securely to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the first impression of plumbless depth was contradicted
by the hedgerows standing up—despite their reflections—much
as before, still with a light powder of the morning’s snow, and
when Jinny advancing to the gate, amid a chaos of ejaculatory
comment that would have done credit to a full-sized congregation,
probed the lake with the point of her umbrella, she exhibited
barely three inches of moist tip. Reassured except for Sunday
shoes, the bulk of the worshippers plashed forwards more or less
boldly. But Miss Gentry refused to be comforted: she was
already half hysterical and clutching at Jinny, for she recalled
her anciently prophesied doom of drowning. What was the use
of a lifelong refusal to set foot on the water? The water was
come to her, as the Clown opined of Ophelia. Jinny could quiet
her only by promising to see her safely to her door. With a
jump the girl reached the four steps by which the ladies anciently
mounted to their pillions, and running up, she surveyed the vista
of waters, amid which the three pollarded lime-trees before Miss
Gentry’s cottage rose like a landmark. She could now make a
mental map of the driest route. For from this observation-post,
though she had a sodden sense of mist and rain and blowiness,
the sense of an unbroken aqueous expanse disappeared. She
could see water, water, but not everywhere, nor were even the
watery parts submerged uniformly. It was like some infallible
illustration of the ups and downs of Little Bradmarsh. Never
before, not even under the varying strains of Methusalem, had
she realized how undulating the village was for all its apparent
flatness. She saw now how much a few feet counted, and how
the majority of the cottages and the farmhouses—all the ancient
ones indeed—had planted themselves along that dry finger:
“the Ridge” they called it, she remembered, though the name
had hitherto been a mere sound to her ear, for so gradual was its
slope that she had never felt the ascent nor put on the brake in
descending. But to see it culminating in the Common and her
own dear Blackwater Hall was now a cheering spectacle. While
a white-flecked, wind-whipped waste of yellow water was spreading
where yesterday blackened pastures had stretched, here were
brown fields quite untouched by the flood-water, with their
furrows chalked out in snow. One field all winter white, with
thin blades just peeping up, looked friendly rather than forlorn—such
was the effect of contrast. Lower down the Ridge were
stretches covered with a deposit of silt and leaf-mould, with
plough-handles sticking up, and between these and the flooded
regions was a half-and-half world that reminded Jinny of the
salt-marshes: a maze of pools and pondlets and water-patterns
in a greenish slime mottled with hillocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking off her precious shoes and stockings, Jinny descended
from her observation-post and plunged the “little fitten”
admired of her grandfather into the chilling muddy lake, which
seemed to have risen since she gauged it. Miss Gentry, clenching
her teeth, followed her example, but in the effort to grasp at
once her skirt, shoes, and muff (with prayer-book couchant), and
to prevent her umbrella from soaring off on adventures of its
own, she made more twitter than progress, and when, at their
first stile, Nip, plunging through the bars, dived into the field
and swam boldly forward, Miss Gentry with a shriek perched
herself on the stile and refused to come down. Jinny, baring
her legs still higher, strove to laugh away her patron’s fears, but
her very precaution of tucking up had driven the dressmaker into
a new frenzy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no risk so long as we dodge the ditches,” Jinny
pointed out, “and you can see those by the hedges. And look
up there—there’s your lime-trees signalling their feet are dry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I can’t get to them. Oh, Jinny, go and fetch me
your cart. Do be a love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sunday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a question of life and death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” Jinny pretended. “If I cut through that field
with the cows I shan’t be long,” she said with cunning carelessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had not gone many yards ere, as she expected, she
heard Miss Gentry plashing desperately behind her with cries of
“Wait for me, Jinny! Wait!” Miss Gentry did not reflect
that the cows would not be out in that weather; to face
those fearsome inches under escort was a lesser evil than the
possible dangers from panic-stricken cattle that now rose before
her mind, and with one horn of the dilemma a bull’s, her choice
was precipitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Four Wantz Way new terrors arose for the poor lady.
It was not from the swirl of waters that met there, for her road
now stretched visibly upwards, but from the fact that the
Pennymoles were occupied in moving their treasures to “the
high room.” The genial paterfamilias darting to his doorstep—with
the kerchiefed owl he was rescuing in his hand—had his own
flood of authoritative lore to pour out, but he could make no
headway till Miss Gentry had blushingly apologized for her bare
feet, and been assured that no respectable man would look at
them. Then, though his hearers stood splashed and blown
about, he held even Jinny spellbound with a description of Long
Bradmarsh as he had known it in his boyhood before the embankment
was put up, and when his parents had often had, even in
summer, to open the back door of their cottage to let the water
pour out. And what a work it had been, clearing up the muck
afterwards! “That’s a terrible thing, the power of water,” he
said solemnly. “People don’t know what it means who ain’t
seen it. And it’s rising every minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did I tell you, Jinny?” cried Miss Gentry. “Oh, Mr.
Pennymole, will my house be safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s one thing, mum, to be in the flood and another to be out
of it,” he responded oracularly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along!” said Jinny impatiently. “Your cottage has
got two steps to begin with, and even if it gets up to your garden,
you’ll be safe inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beggin’ your pardon, Jinny,” corrected the oracle. “That
fares to sap the foundations, and then crack! bang! you think
it’s a big gun, and down comes walls and ceilings. My gran’fer
seen a whole row of cottages washed away. And then there’s
flotsam what bangs about and smashes you in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gentry clutched wildly at Jinny, dropping shoes and
muff into the swirl. “And Squibs does hate to get her feet wet,”
she babbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alarmed at the effect of his pronouncement, the oracle hastened
to tone it down and to pick up her things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No need to get into a pucker, mum. You’re all right, same
as you’re in the high room. And Oi count ye’ve got a grate
upstairs, which is more than we’re blessed with this weather.
That gre’t ole stove can’t git up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you could sew in your bedroom,” Jinny added soothingly.
“You’ve never known it get higher than the ground
floor, have you, Mr. Pennymole?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in <span class='it'>my</span> born days,” answered the oracle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s always new things happening,” wailed Miss
Gentry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s wunnerful true,” Mr. Pennymole admitted, smiling.
“Oi never thought Oi’d fare to oversleep myself. But the day
there was that grand wedding at the church, Oi hadn’t time to
make my tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then he had two teas!” put in Mrs. Pennymole
hilariously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before the story had proceeded far, they all became aware
of people hastening from every quarter towards the unsubmerged
regions, not for safety, but for salvage; carts and even wagons
with teams began to come up, and the bustle and cackle recalled
Mr. Pennymole to public duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving his wife to finish telling the story, as well as transferring
the furniture, he joined a party hurrying on to Farmer
Gale’s five-acre field, and as Jinny and Miss Gentry passed along,
they saw potato clamps being dug up, cattle driven higher, corn
and hay unstacked and transported, and even threshing in hasty
operation. The Sunday clothes of those who hadn’t stayed to
“shiften,” but emphasized the profanity of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see what Dissenters are!” said Miss Gentry in
disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a matter of life and death,” quoted Jinny maliciously.
But Miss Gentry did not recognize her own words. Jinny went
on to praise the true Christianity of these labourers, who though
ground down to a miserable wage, were now dashing to Farmer
Gale’s assistance even in his absence—for he had apparently not
yet returned from his place of worship at Chipstone. One cornstack
saved, she calculated, would be worth more than he had
paid Mr. Pennymole in the last five years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this dreadful day of the Lord, it’s souls that want saving,
not stacks,” said Miss Gentry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arrived at last on her own doorstep, she collapsed in Jinny’s
arms. What was the use of not going to Boulogne, she demanded,
if she was to be drowned in her bed? At least she might have
had the hope of seeing her dear Cleopatra again. And surely
the darling must have written, must have sent her address.
Bundock must have lost the letters, or, worse, suppressed them!
He owed her a grudge because she had resisted his importunities.
Yes, Jinny—dead to Passion—had no idea to what lengths
people born under other planets would go—even though married!
But, extricating herself, Jinny, with that cold blood of hers, left
her patron to the consolations of Squibs; she must get home to
her grandfather, she explained; he would be worrying over
her fate.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>She found him at his telescope, as outraged as Miss Gentry,
and enjoying himself immensely over the spectacle that shattered
his Sunday dullness. His big Bible had been lugged upstairs,
and now lay on the bed, open at the Deluge; and the bucket
that received his ceiling-drippings had been kicked over in his
excitement. “That’s the Lord’s punishment on they Sabbath-breakers,”
he said gleefully. Nor could all Jinny’s arguments—as
she wiped up his private flood—bring home to him his inverted
logic. “The Lord knowed ’twas in their hearts to break it,” he
persisted. “ ‘And it repented the Lord that He had made
man.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s not so bad as the flood of 2352,” said Jinny, airing
her Spelling-Book chronology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait till the Brad flows over the dyke,” he chuckled.
“That’ll spill all over Long Bradmarsh, ay, and run down
towards Chipstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you don’t think it will get over the dyke?” she said
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mebbe to Babylon itself,” he said voluptuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the more reason they should try to save what they can,”
she urged. “Time and tide wait for no man, and why should
any man wait for the tide? It’s like with shepherds and
stockmen that can’t ever have their Sunday. Come down to
dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Gaffer’s eye was glued to his tube. “That’s as good
as harvest!” he exclaimed in shocked exhilaration. “Dash my
buttons ef they ain’t thatchin’ the stack they carted over from
Pipit’s meadow. And they’re makin’ new mangold and potato
clamps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long as they don’t get largesse,” Jinny maintained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gaffer groaned. “Largesse or no largesse, Oi never seen
sech a Sunday in all my born days. What a pity Sidrach dedn’t
live to see it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she at last got him to surrender the spy-glass, she could
not refrain from taking a peep herself. She was astonished at
the swift rise of the waters. Already the hedgerows were disappearing,
while an avenue of elms rising mysteriously out of a
lagoon was the sole indication of a road she had passed on her
way to church. A swan and cygnets were now sailing upon it,
with darker and less distinguishable objects tossing around. A
bed of osiers seemed to be in its natural element as it rose from
the waters that islanded a farm. The black, snow-powdered barn
looked like the upturned hull of some squat galleon, and the
haystacks thatched as with hoar-frost had the air of cliffs
crumbling before the sea. One clump of bare trees rose out of
the glassy void like the rigging of a sinking ship. Her world had
suffered a water-change into something rich and strange in which
only the rare protuberances enabled her to trace out the original
earth-pattern. Even seagulls were floating, and frank-herons
wheeling, and kingfishers diving. Her grandfather watched her
like one who had provided the show. “That makes me feel a
youngster agen,” he cried. “ ’Tis like the good ole times when
there warn’t no drainage-mills ne yet Frog Farms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frog Farm isn’t swept away?” she cried with a sudden
clamminess at her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi wouldn’t give much for the farniture downstairs,” he
said, with sinister satisfaction. “That’s the lowest house in the
parish. And then ye deny ’tis the Lord’s hand a-chastenin’ the
evil-doers. Oi reckon though they’ve packed their waluables in
the coach, the pirate thieves, and scuttled off Beacon Hill way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without replying, she gazed through a tremulous telescope at
the distant point where the Brad seemed to wind immediately
behind the roof of Frog Farm but the convolutions and dip of
the land, aided by an intervening copse, hid everything from her
except the quaint chimney, though the smoke fluttering in the
wind showed that if the Gaffer’s hypothesis was correct, evacuation
must have been recent. It was something, though, to see
the farmhouse still uncollapsed, though her imagination surrounded
it with water like the more visible farm. She was glad
to remember that Master Peartree at least would have been in
his hut on higher ground, keeping vigil over the lambing ewes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody ought to go and see if they’ve really got away,”
she said anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll be all right ef the Lord don’t want to punish ’em,”
he said surlily. “And ef He do, ’tain’t for nobody to baulk
Him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner he forwent his nap. The Lord had sent him not
only a spectacle but a great new eye, and had even denuded the
trees that might in summer have blocked his view, and he was
not the man to “sin his mercies.” Jinny had ceased to be anxious
about his catching cold at the casement—evidently his life of
driving had inured him—so, wrapping a blanket round his smock
and the new-knitted muffler round his throat, she left him to
enjoy himself while she cleared away the frugal meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she heard a roar as of distant thunder, followed by
a great shout from above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s busted! It’s busted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rushed up in alarm, nearly upsetting his bucket herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold!” he cried Biblically, handing her the glass.
“That’s busted a piece out of the bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked—and beheld indeed! In the embankment that
guarded Long Bradmarsh gaped a breach of some fifty yards, while
giant blocks of clay that must have weighed tons were swirling
like children’s marbles towards the Long Bradmarsh meadows
whence panic-stricken labourers were now fleeing backwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s caught ’em, the Sabbath-breakers,” said the Gaffer
ecstatically. “That didn’t wait to flow over the dyke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to go and give help on the Ridge,” she said resolutely.
And not all his arguments or threats could stay her cart. “Christ
said the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath,”
she urged, and the text silenced him. But it was not so easy to
dispose of the pietism of Methusalem, whose blank incredulity
before her threatened disturbance of the holy day was only
overcome by the convincing commonplaceness with which Nip
barked around. The poor horse must have imagined that he
had overslept himself and that it was Tuesday. Fortunately
“the Ridge” lay downwards for him, and the crowds and the
everyday bustle finally disillusioned him of his Sunday feeling,
and he allowed his cart to be laden with the carrots, swedes, and
mangolds that had lain in such snug rows packed betwixt hurdles
and a sort of straw thatch kept down by long poles. At first
Jinny kept looking round for the rival carrier, but either he
would not demean his coach to such service, or he was water-bound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny asked several people whether they had seen the Flynts
and whether Frog Farm would be safe, but if nobody could
supply any information, nobody thought there would be any
serious danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>They’ll</span> be all right,” said Farmer Gale bitterly. “It’s my
land there that’s drowned, and my stacks that are floating.” He
was on the scene now, directing operations, cursing his looker.
For the first time the breezy Cornishman doubted his father’s cuteness
in buying up soil whose fatness was only due to its centuries of
repose under water. “The land’ll be out of heart for years,” he
lamented. Jinny could not help a secret satisfaction in seeing
the hard-hearted farmer confronted by a force as remorseless as
that which had swept Uncle Lilliwhyte out of his cottage. Nor
could she escape a still subtler pleasure in thus heaping coals of
fire on his head. But both these joys as well as her anxiety
about Frog Farm were soon lost in the glow of service. It was
such a delight to be no longer shamming work, while to give had
become an almost forgotten pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she returned to the field for a second load, the flood was
already creeping over it, and the early darkness and a pale
quarter-moon threw a new weirdness over these unknown
waters. She found the lane outside still more flooded, and as
Methusalem plashed homewards, she encountered Uncle Lilliwhyte
rising from the waters like a disreputable river-god. He
was dexterously spearing mangolds as they floated past, and
stacking them, mixed with drowned hares, in a wheelbarrow,
itself apparently flotsam. He had an air of legal operations,
there was none of the furtive look that goes with bulges in
smock-frocks, and Jinny, too, thought he was justly avenged on
his evictor, though she refused to desecrate the Sabbath by
buying any of his spoils. She could not help feeling rewarded
when Nip appeared with a rabbit gratis. As he had not killed
it, she refrained from rebuking him, and he came in subsequently
for the bones. But his pride at having thus at last achieved his
ideal almost turned his head, and all the more bitter was his
humiliation when his next epoch-making capture—a dead rat—was
rejected with reproach.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>If Jinny had much to tell her grandfather over the rabbit
stew, he in his turn had no lack of material for excited conversation.
Both were exhilarated, rejuvenated by the metamorphosis
of their landscape; it seemed, more pungently even than snow,
to re-create the wonder of the world. It was a gay young
grandfather that rattled off the farces and tragedies of the day’s
drama: a sodden haystack hurled into the Brad, a cart of
mangolds overturned in a watery field, a bullock swimming for
dear life and landing safely on a mound where stampeded horses
cowered; dead ewes floating—and just in the lambing season
too!—men in boats rescuing pigs and poultry from the grounds
of water-logged cottages, and hauling clothes and bedding through
the windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s hundreds o’ Farmer Gale’s acres drowned what was
cropped with seed,” he said with gloomy relish, “and regiments
o’ rats ha’ saved theirselves atop of his stacks. When they’ve
goffled their fill they wentures down for a drink, the warmints,
and then up again. Same as ’twixt the devil and the deep sea
for they onfortunit stacks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night a white mist rising from the waters blotted out
everything, but the next morning, when Jinny went up to induce
her grandfather to descend to breakfast, she found to her surprise
and relief that though the Brad was still hurling itself through
the breach, the bulk of Long Bradmarsh was still unflooded, still
alive with salvage parties. The low arms of the marsh-mills
were still working with frantic efficiency. What miracle had
saved this village? Her grandfather explained that there must
still be some righteous men there. But Jinny, looking through
his glass for herself, discovered—after a preliminary peep at the
Frog Farm chimney, whose smokelessness was a fresh relief—that
the breach-water instead of flowing evenly over Long
Bradmarsh had half found, half scooped out for itself, a sort of
river-bed. Turning aside before a slight rise, it had veered
round sharply eastward, and then curving back westward, when
it met another obstacle three hundred yards later, it had finally
poured itself over the dyke back into the Brad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a mercy,” she said, expounding it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now there’s a chance of both they rivers flowin’ over,”
he pointed out hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as she gazed, she grew aware of a new phenomenon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the Brad’s going backwards!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He snatched the glass from her hand. “So it be!” he agreed.
“But that’s onny where the little river busts in agen the wrong
way and pours along the top o’ the real river.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was thrilling all down her spine. Again the sibylline
prophecy of Miss Gentry rang in her ears:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>When the Brad in opposite ways shall course,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Lo! Jinny’s husband shall come on a horse,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>And Jinny shall then learn Passion’s force.</span></p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Overwhelmed by the uncanny divination of the dressmaker—a
“wise woman” in good sooth it now appeared—she sank into
a chair, her whole being aquiver with a premonition that she
had reached the crucial point of her destiny. Who was it
coming on a horse? Who but Will, that incarnation of equestrian
grace? He was coming to rescue her, the dear silly,
imagining her menaced by the flood. As if she had not got
Methusalem! As if Blackwater Hall was not an Ararat! But
his foolishness was part of the Fate—might he not even ride his
horse through the doorway, lying along its back to avoid the
lintel, and thus be practically “on his hands and knees”? In
her grandfather’s present happy mood, the old man might very
well accept that solution. And Will himself would be “carried
in,” and might equally accept the compromise. Absorbed in her
sophistic day-dream, she sat there till even the old man at his
tube remembered breakfast. Nor did she again volunteer to
help in the fields. All day she stayed at home over her Monday
housework and wash-tub, awaiting the horseman, afraid to
stir out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with equal patience her grandfather sat at his all-day
show. Engineers and gesticulating figures appeared on the
broken bank for his delectation, and a mile or so lower down
labourers began to shovel gault (culch, he called it to Jinny), and
lighters laden with it tried to sink themselves in the breach, but
some were swirled away like bandboxes and others turned
turtle—a comical sight that made him roar with laughter. At
last exciting operations with ropes, stretched across the river,
succeeded in keeping some in place. After that a big-sailed
barge came to the rescue—he could even recognize the two
punters with long poles who eked out the sail. Ravens’ grandson,
that ne’er-do-well, and Ephraim Bidlake, whose grandfather’s
barge used to “competition wuss than coaches,” he told
Jinny. They had brought a cargo of the blue-grey stuff—hundreds
of sacks—and “dinged” it into the breach, wellnigh
clogging it up. And then—oh side-splitting drollery!—the dyke
had gone and “busted” in another weak place—near the bridge.
And they were left “like dickies” with empty sacks, while the
folk in the new-swamped fields went scurrying like rats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So continuous were her grandfather’s shouts of glee that
Jinny ceased to attend to them, and would not come up to see
even the new gap. She was the more amazed when at supper
he talked of having seen “ ’Lijah Skindle” fishing from the
window of Frog Farm. “Oi called ye to come and see,” he said
reproachfully when she expressed incredulity. “He got his line
danglin’ from a broomstick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of Miss Gentry astride a broomstick seemed far
likelier to Jinny. In the first place, no window of the farmhouse
was visible from theirs; in the second, how could Elijah Skindle
be living there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would Mr. Skindle be doing at Frog Farm?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long as he ain’t taken Annie there!” he answered. “Oi
shouldn’t wonder ef the whole place comes tumblin’ down like
they fir-trees. For the more Oi set thinkin’ on it, the more Oi
see as it’s to punish that competitioning pirate that the flood’s
been sent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk like that, Gran’fer. I expect you’ve been dozing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi tell you Oi seen him and his broomstick,” he cried angrily.
“And when he couldn’t catch nawthen, he tied his han’kercher
on it and signalled with it, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did remember now that Elijah and Will had become
thicker than their respective relations to Blanche seemed to
warrant, and she had shrewdly divined that Will wanted to
flaunt his indifference to his rejection, and Elijah to pose as the
magnanimous conqueror. It was not impossible, therefore, that
the horse-doctor, summoned to Snowdrop or Cherry-blossom on
the Saturday afternoon, had been caught by the torrential rain
and the gale and persuaded to stay the night in that spare
bedroom once occupied by Mr. Flippance. But more probably
it was only another of the old man’s illusions. “Why, there
wasn’t even any smoke from the chimney,” she reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mebbe there was too much water in it,” he chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s blood ran cold, but not on account of the Flynts. She
was still too obsessed with the vision of Will arriving on a horse
to imagine him or his parents immured by the waters. No, the
feeling that stole over her was that Elijah Skindle was not <span class='it'>living</span>
at the farm, but that while the occupants had evacuated it, he
had been drowned outside it—swept away with his trap—and
that her grandfather had seen yet another ghost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If anybody was signalling,” she pointed out, “the engineers
and the wherrymen would have seen him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can’t see through a brick wall,” he retorted crushingly.
“Frog Farm ain’t got no eyes on the Brad. Depend on’t, ’tis
the Lord’s finger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was still incredulous. But the moment supper was over,
she ran up to examine the farmhouse afresh. The wind had
“sobbed down”; the sky was sprinkled with stars, seen through
frequent rifts in the clouds; and the moon, though only a
crescent, emerging through a cloud-rack, shed a silver radiance
over the watery waste, and cast over it black rippling bands of
shadow from the bare elms and poplars rising from it in such
unearthly beauty. And there in the region of Frog Farm,
perceptible even to the naked eye, a mysterious reddish-yellow
light, like some new star, threw its far-reaching beams upon the
softened flood. A closer examination revealed that some of the
trees of the fir-copse had been sapped and now lay heaving
gently—the old man, she remembered, had alluded to fallen firs—and
that the ruddy rays came from a farm bedroom, no longer
shut out by the foliage. The smoke, too, was rising again. It
was clear that the house was not uninhabited, and that her
grandfather might very well have seen Elijah Skindle, while the
absence of smoke all day might be traceable to the inability of
the occupants to get a light earlier from sodden matches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if they are starving and signalling,” she cried agitatedly,
“we must tell people. We must send a boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t get no boat,” he said philosophically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ve seen plenty of boats,” she urged. “I saw two
myself rowing over the five-acre field. And there’s that fowling-punt
on the bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That! Oi seen that fleetin’ bottom up! Ye can’t goo out
to-night. Ye’d be drownded. Why, look there! That’s a dead
cow from the Farm meadow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where? I can’t see anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! Bobbin’ near the copse.” He pointed and snatched
the glass from her. “Why, that’s a hoss,” he shouted exultantly,
“a black hoss! That should be Snowdrop, ef it ain’t Cherry-blossom!”
He was on his feet now, quivering with excitement,
his blanket falling from his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how can you be sure in this light?” she said, trembling
no less. “It may be a brown horse, or even a plough-horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a black coach-hoss sure enough, black as his heart, the
pirate thief. What did Oi tell ye? ‘Wengeance is mine, saith
the Lord. Oi will repay.’ ” He looked so solemn in the moonlight,
with his white beard, and his white-sleeved arm pointing
starward, that she almost felt his standpoint had a prophetic
justification. But she shook off the spell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Gran’fer,” she pleaded, readjusting his blanket.
“Mr. Flynt was in his right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef he was in his right, why has the Lord drownded his hoss?”
he demanded fiercely. “Do ye set down, yerself.” And he
clutched her wrist with his bony hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go!” she cried. “There’s Mr. Skindle to be saved
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t no danger for <span class='it'>them</span>—’tis your boat what ’ud come
into colloosion with trees and cattle and fences and—why, just
look at that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped her hand to scrutinize the strange object awash.
“Hallelujah!” he cried hysterically. “That’s the top o’ the
coach! Dedn’t Oi say ’twas a funeral coach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shivered, and a cloud, coming just then over the moon,
seemed to eclipse her resolution to rouse the neighbours. The
sudden pall of darkness made the old man clutch her again—his
own evocation of the funeral coach had frightened him. “Oi
won’t be left alone by night,” he quavered and wiped a watery
eye. Jinny refused to take it as pathos. “You’ll blind yourself
with that telescope,” she said sternly. But inwardly she felt he
was not so wrong. In that dim fitful light there was more
danger to the would-be rescuers than to the party so snugly
gathered round some bedroom hearth in Frog Farm. That
ruddy lamplight, still brighter by the extinction of the moon,
beamed reassuringly over the waters. Skindle’s broomstick-rod
might have represented merely an effort to break the monotony
of imprisonment—it was no proof that they had been cut off
from their larder. And with the waters now calmer, the house
that had stood the gale was not likely to subside in the night.
No, they were probably safer where they were than if “rescued.”
She must wait till the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A loud thumping at the kitchen-door shattered her speculations.
Jinny’s heart beat almost as loudly. So the horseman
had come at last, unheard in their excitement, choosing the back
door as less of a surrender. Will had escaped then. He was not
water-logged. She flew down the stairs three at a time. Poor
Will! Poor Snowdrop—or was it Snowdrop that was saved and
was now bearing his master to the heart that would give him
compensation for all his shattered fortunes? Alas, no proud
cavalier waited to bear her off clasped to his breast, no smoking
steed—only a tatterdemalion before whose malodorous corduroys
and battered beaver she recoiled in as much disgust as disappointment,
though Uncle Lilliwhyte bore in his grimy claws a plump
partridge, for which he demanded only twopence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the season’s over,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s onny the tother day and ’twarnt me as killed it,” he
said. “The Lord don’t seem to care about they game laws; He
killed even on Sunday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take the Lord’s name in vain,” Jinny rebuked him.
“We can’t understand His ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They do seem wunnerful odd,” admitted the nondescript.
“Ever since Oi was a brat Oi’ve tried to puzzle ’em out, but it
git over me. Same as a man now perished in this here flood,
and went straight to hell. Wouldn’t that be a cur’ous change for
the chap—like the Lord larkin’ with him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps there’ll be a flood that will put out hell one day,”
said Jinny evasively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martha Flynt should be sayin’ there ain’t no hell to put out.
That looks as if ye’ve got to goo to Heaven, do what ye will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t think she means that,” said Jinny, smiling despite
her heavy heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what the humes sounded like as her and the looker
used to sing of a Sunday afore Master Will come home and
stopped ’em. Oi used to listen to ’em chance times—put me in
mind of my young days like—but Oi don’t howd with their
doctrines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With whose then?” asked Jinny, interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With nobody’s. Dedn’t Oi say, git over me? Ef the Lord
was to offer me Heaven or Hell, which d’ye think Oi’d choose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a catch in it?” she asked cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to be catched in one or the tother,” he said, misunderstanding.
“But Oi mislikes ’em both. Will you be
buyin’ the bird?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Jinny produced two of her only three pennies, she began to
realize for the first time the revolution in her fortunes implicit
in the destruction of the coach. But her heart was aching too
poignantly for any joy of victory. She could not savour, as her
grandfather was savouring, the miraculous collapse of the competition.
Victory or defeat—heaven or hell—she thought ruefully,
she misliked them both. She was consumed with yearning,
anxiety and compassion for the young rival who had failed to
“come on a horse,” who had perhaps no longer even a single horse
to come on. Nor did the fate of Snowdrop or Cherry-blossom—that
superb vitality turned into a floating carcase—leave her
jubilant. In the morning, indeed, she was to awake to a sense
of her triumph. But what endless hours of insomnia and nightmare
had first to be lived through! Again Queen Victoria, who
was also quite intelligibly Miss Jinny Boldero, was saved by
“The Father of the Fatherless” from the gins and stratagems
of the red-haired villain who cut away London Bridge just as
Her Majesty was going over it in her gold coronation coach with
its six black ponies and its canvas tilt. Struggling in the cold
waters, she was held up by Henry Brougham, Esq., who helped
her to scramble athwart the naked carcase of a black pony on
which she floated to shore, when it stood upon its feet, and with
Queen Jinny astride the saddle and Miss Gentry (in bridal attire)
not at all surprisingly on the pillion, galloped towards Blackwater
Hall across the dry Common where anglers sat with broomsticks.
And while she was lying along the pony’s mane to get through
the door to the red-haired young man (now become the hero),
just as she was beginning to feel Passion’s force, that stupid
Miss Gentry came crack with her neck against the lintel, and off
rolled her head on the floor, its moustache dabbled in blood.
Picking herself up, and her scattered bedclothes, and rubbing
her bruised crown, Jinny congratulated herself on sleeping in a
chest of drawers in such proximity to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the bang, slight as it was, had cleared away the vapours
of sleep and she awoke to a consciousness of victory brimming
her veins with vital joy. Song, so long strange to her lips, unless
simulated to lull Gran’fer, came back to them as she dressed, and
when she prayed “Give us this day our daily bread,” it was no
longer an almost despairing cry to a deaf heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Running upstairs to see if Frog Farm was safe, she was relieved
to find it smoking imperturbably, though up to its bedrooms in
water, and a glimpse of Caleb at the casement serenely lowering
a bucket into the flood was still more reassuring. But she was
thunderstruck when her grandfather gleefully pointed out that
the bridge to Long Bradmarsh had broken down, almost as in
her dream, and she half looked round for the coronation coach.
Doubtless, she felt, surveying the broken bankside arch, which
lay in uncouth masses impeding the current and sending it
swirling through the still-standing central arch, the breach
hard by in the dyke had helped to sap the bridge, and
she was glad to see this breach being already repaired by
her friends, Bidlake and Ravens, with a gang of labourers, for
they were clearly heaven-sent minions for the expedition to
Frog Farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if she sang on as she cleared the breakfast things, her
grandfather was in still higher feather. Not only had the
morning brought to him as to Jinny a keener realization of the
collapse of their mushroom rival, but he had discovered floating
near the bridge a black horse which he persisted was the second
horse, and though Jinny maintained it was the same horse, the
old man had more faith in heaven. So occupied was he in
gloating over this distant horse swirling against the ruined
brickwork, with its stiffened leg pointing skywards, that he had
not seen Methusalem harnessing under his nose, and it was not
till Nip started his hysteric prelude to departure that Mr. Quarles
was aroused to Jinny’s proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye can’t goo out in the flood,” he called down in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Tuesday,” she called up. The blood was dancing gaily
in her veins. The frosty morning air was fresh and invigorating.
She was young and unconquered. The long anxiety was over.
Methusalem had survived the coach, even as he had survived the
murderous wiles of Elijah! She put her horn to her lips and
blew a challenge to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there bain’t no bridge,” cried her grandfather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daniel Quarles hasn’t been downed by a coach,” she said,
“and he isn’t going to be downed by a flood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, by God, he ain’t!” cried the old Carrier delightedly.
“Oi’ll goo round miles by the next bridge sooner than miss my
day. And they false customers’ll ha’ to come to me on their
hands and knees ere Oi takes ’em back. Goo to the coach, ye
warmints, Oi’m done wi’ ye! And Oi wish ye joy of your fine
black hosses all a-jinglin’ and a-tinklin’. He, he, he! Make
muddles, do Oi? Oi never made no muddle like that, stablin’
my hosses with the frogs. Do ye give a squint at that carcase,
Jinny, as ye pass by and ye’ll see it ain’t the one but the tother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do ye don’t squint into that spy-glass no more,” she
called up in merry earnest. “Do, ye’ll get a glass eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “No fear. Have they writ ye yet about
Sidrach’s stone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Annoyed with herself at having called up that memory, she
feigned deafness. “You’ll find partridge for your dinner,” she
called out, and flicking playfully at Methusalem she burst forth
joyously: “<span class='it'>There is Hey</span>——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>There is Ree!</span>” responded the sepulchral bass from above,
and then as the old horse stepped out, both voices declared in
duet that ’twas Methusalem bore the bells away. Jinny, waving
her whip with a last backward glance at her grandfather, saw
him wildly agitating his telescope, to which his coloured handkerchief
was tied like a flag of victory.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Methusalem waded stolidly towards the river, his cart nearly
floating in places. On the drier artificial slope leading up to
the bridge she drew rein, and, jumping down, walked cautiously
over the two still standing arches to hail Ephraim Bidlake, now
some hundred yards down the opposite bank. As she put her
horn to her lips to summon him, she saw, quanted up-stream,
another barge with a reinforcement of sacks, and as it must pass
under the bridge she moved to the other side to send her message
by it as it came along. But the posse of mud-grimed men with
a last push of their submerged poles fell prostrate before her, as in
some Oriental obeisance, and she heard the tops of the gault-sacks
scraping against the brickwork of the arch as the boat
passed under it, so high was the water. It reminded her again of
her nightmare. But no heads came crack as they glided through,
and running to the other side, she spoke the rising crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning, she became aware of Bundock standing, bag-bowed, on
the dyke, amid a mass of sodden straw, gazing in horror at the
ruins and the dead horse bashing against them, swathed in
yellow weed. She advanced to the edge of the void and hailed
him across some fifteen feet of eddying water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahoy, Bundock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, Jinny!” he cried, startled. “Go back!
That’ll give way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not with <span class='it'>my</span> weight!” she laughed. “You going
across?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s boats, barges, wherries, lighters, punts, and swimming,”
called Jinny, “and you’ve got to do your duty to the
Queen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And haven’t I done it?” he said pathetically, exhibiting his
soused leggings. “But there’s only three letters for Little
Bradmarsh and all for the same man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can guess who that is,” she said. “And yet you won’t
kill three frogs with one stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock burst into laughter. “So you’ve heard my joke,” he
said happily. “I do liven folks up, don’t I, though few have
the brains to appreciate aught beyond the Bellman’s silly puns.”
Then his ruddy, pitted countenance resumed its melancholy
mien. “But I can’t joke about the flood, Jinny, you mustn’t
expect me to. There’s poor Charley Mott!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what’s he got to do with water?” Jinny jested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you heard? He’s drowned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny’s laugh froze on her lips. Charley had obstinately gone
to fish in the troubled waters of the Brad, the postman related,
despite the weather. All the Sunday morning he had fished
from the dyke, and was just walking off to dine with some pals
at “The King of Prussia” when the bank burst, and he was
caught by the torrent and smashed among the whirling blocks.
It was exactly like the moral of the Spelling-Book, and Jinny
saw before her as on a scroll of judgment the grey blurred type
of Lesson XV: “Harry’s Downfall.” True, Harry had been
torn by wild beasts as well as shipwrecked on the coast of
Barbary, but in a country without the larger carnivora a
complete analogy could not be expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Mr. Mott,” she sighed. And then, remembering the
case put by Uncle Lilliwhyte, had the luckless young man
indeed gone straight from water to fire, she wondered. “It’ll be
a relief for Mrs. Mott anyhow,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A relief?” gasped Bundock. “Why, she’s carrying on like
mad. Says it’s all her fault for trying to drive him to chapel.
And that it was Deacon Mawhood that egged her on to drive him
on the curb. And that he was worth a dozen Deacons, and she
won’t have any more to do with you Peculiars. Why, when I
brought her the letters this morning, if she hadn’t kept me such
a time pouring out all Charley’s virtues, I might have got across
before this bridge broke down. Not that I could have delivered
my letters anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it broke in the night,” said Jinny. Then she fell
silent, disconcerted by these illogical manifestations of human
nature, and she did not remember where she was till she found
Nip tugging at her dress and cowering on the brink of the abyss,
as if afraid she would be walking on. The wherry, she perceived
too, was now coming up, and young Ravens’ voice was floating
melodiously across the waters:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s your ferry, Bundock!” she called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what’s the good of going across?” he asked. “By
what I see I couldn’t possibly get to Frog Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m going there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” He gazed towards her side of the river, the
willows surging from which alone marked the former bank.
Plover were flying with dismal cries over the unseen pastures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head: “One inquest’s enough for Chipstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take your letters,” she said with a sudden thought that
made her happier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bundock resisted the offer. His repugnance to seeing the
Queen’s mail sacrilegiously carried by a member of Her Majesty’s
sex was deep-seated, and it was only because he took seriously
Jinny’s threat to write to his sovereign that he finally handed
the three letters by a compromise to Ephraim Bidlake. Needless
to say that as soon as Bundock’s pouched back was turned, that
faithful henchman transferred them to Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he took her little horse and cart on board his broad-built
wherry, he imagined she only wanted to be ferried across,
but she had soon spurred him to the great adventure across the
“drowned” meadows. It was a question of life-saving, she said,
and for the British Navy as embodied in Bidlake and Ravens,
this was enough. Fortunately the females were now lodged on
shore, awaiting Mrs. Bidlake’s annual event. Moreover the
wherry, relieved by the other barge, had a slack moment, and
with Jinny to guide them from the vantage-point of her driving-board
over hidden snags in the shape of submerged stiles, sheds,
mounds or bushes, the two men punted boldly over the left bank.
The mast had been lowered, for apart from the danger of boughs
catching in the sail, the trees made a wind-screen to the pastures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was odd as the barge passed between two willows on the
margin of the river, to see these trees reflected doubly, at
once in stream and in flood. There was no difficulty in avoiding
the larger flotsam, though one of Farmer Gale’s haystacks was
only staved off with Bidlake’s pole, and it was not till they had
quanted to the farmhouse itself that the steering became troublesome,
for there were no windows at the back, at which they were
arriving, there were farm-buildings and floating stacks waiting
to embarrass them at the front, the so-called Frog Cottage
presented a blank black wall at one side, while the windowed
side-wall, from which Martha had once beheld Bundock marching
through morasses, was encumbered, not only by the wreckage of
the stable and the mangled body of the coach, but by Caleb’s
wild “orchard,” in whose mystically rising oak-branches and
pear-tree-tops poultry, to which fear had restored wings, were
seen to be roosting. But by taking a wide course over the
wheat-patch so as to avoid the stacks, the barge was able to
double Frog Cottage safely, to glide triumphantly into dock,
and lie alongside Frog Farm. The exciting manœuvre had been
accomplished in grim silence—even Ravens forgetting to sing as
they bumped over the chaotic remains of the old log-dyke and
raised wagon-road—and it was not till it was over that Jinny
found breath to blow her horn. And as she did so, she was
startled to see behind the diamond panes of the closed casement
of the central bedroom—now on a level with her driving-board
and almost opposite it—a head that vaguely recalled Mr. Duke’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the next instant she recognized Maria, and the old black sow
was pushed aside, the casement flung open and a red-haired head
flung out. And if Jinny had stared incredulously at the sight
of the pig, what word can convey the dilatation of Will’s eyes
as they now beheld the little Carrier perched on her accustomed
seat, whip in hand, as though on the solid road! It
was some seconds before he even perceived the barge sustaining
her cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” broke harshly from his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such ungraciousness after the perils of her voyage jarred upon
her. “Don’t <span class='it'>you</span> want anything from Chipstone?” she asked,
with a malice she had not intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he barked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here’s your letters I’ve <span class='it'>carried</span>,” she said demurely.
“The postal service, like the coach service, has broken down.”
She hurled the letters through the window just as he was banging
it to, but ere it could close it was thrown open again, and Elijah,
Maria, Martha, and Caleb were tumbling over one another in
their eagerness to greet her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jinny!” came from all their mouths, even, it seemed, from
Maria’s, and she saw through dimming eyes that the bedroom
was a chaos of furniture and fowls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, catch hold of that rope, one of ye,” cried Ephraim
Bidlake. “Tie it to a bedpost.” He had already fastened the
stem of the boat to an oak, but the current was swinging out the
stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with a thrill that Jinny found herself gazing for the
first time into Will’s bedroom, though its normal character was
disturbed by its emergency use as a sitting-room, poultry-run,
pigsty, and salvage store. The wet crinkled motto: “When He
giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?” was lying as if
in ironic questioning atop a pile of parlour ornaments, and
Martha’s silk sampler lay stained and sodden on the very chair
on which Mr. Flippance had sat admiring it. “Unstable as water,”
human destinies seemed to Jinny as she surveyed the jumble in
the whitewashed attic. But there was too much bustle for
reflection, nor could she even see clearly what Will himself was
doing, for Maria and Elijah were jostling each other at the
window in their efforts to get through, and the vet.’s cap fell on
the deck in his agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pigs first!” called Jinny, and as though obediently, Elijah
clutching at the edge of her tilt scrambled on the foot-board of
the cart and thence to the deck. “Nice behaviour, leaving us
to starve,” he grumbled in the same pachydermatous spirit, as
he clapped his cap on his chilled cranium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you starve with all those fowls?” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They weren’t for weekday eating, the old woman said.
Nothing since Sunday but dry bread!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As long as it was dry,” Jinny laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t even that! Simply sopping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all prisoners get bread and water,” said Jinny in mock
consolation. Ravens had hastened to pull out a greasy package.
Elijah waved it aside with a sniffy air. “Thanks—I’ll wait till
we land now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elijah <span class='it'>not</span> fed by Ravens,” laughed Jinny. Outwardly she
was in the gayest of moods, bandying words again in quite her
old vein. But it was a feverish gaiety—underneath, every nerve
was astrain for Will’s reappearance with all it forboded of ecstasy
and conflict. “Come along, Maria,” she called, for the barge
had drifted out a little on its window-rope, and the sow’s eagerness
was damped. Now encouraged, she allowed herself to be helped
into the cart by Caleb above and Bidlake below. After the fowls
had been chivied beside her, there was a delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The missus be in our bedroom packin’ some things for the
night,” apologized Caleb, returning to the window. “She can’t
sleep without her nightcap, it wouldn’t be decent, and she likes
me to change my red shirt for bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where will you sleep?” Jinny now asked, feeling
suddenly responsible as for an eviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Skindle’s kindly offered to put us all up till we looks
round,” said Caleb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the big house I’m furnishing for my wedding regardless,”
Elijah explained. “And I’m going to give them their food, too,
and it isn’t the sort of food they’ve given me either. But when
you’re cooped up with folks in danger of your life, you get closer
to them and don’t grudge expense, especially when they’re in
low water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In low water?” echoed Jinny. “Oh, Mr. Skindle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what I mean,” Elijah replied. “Poor Will’s lost
his horses—such a come-down. Not that he ever had enough to
appeal to a girl brought up to be a lady. In my new house now
there’s three spare bedrooms—I’ll get my mother to make ’em
all ready—that’ll be one apiece for ’em if they care to spread
themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then how about Maria?” Jinny jested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maria!” he grunted. “It’s all her fault. I always said
she was the fussiest pig I ever attended. A mere cramp, through
not taking exercise all this rainy weather; fright cured her in a
jiffy. But think of the valuable time she’s cost me! I wouldn’t
have come but to oblige Will. No wonder they call the place
Frog Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t hear any croaking but yours,” flashed Jinny. “Why,
if time is all you’ve lost, you’re lucky. Where’s <span class='it'>your</span> horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t think I’d risk Jess on these roads in the weather
we’ve been having? I only agreed to come in the coach Saturday
night and go back Sunday morning with Farmer Gale and his
wife when they drove in to chapel. Poor Blanche! She must
have been in a terrible twitter when I didn’t turn up at the
Sunday dinner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder she didn’t come out for you in a boat?” said Jinny
slyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’d be thinking I’d been called to another patient. We
medical gents can never call our time our own,” he explained, but
there was a tremor of uneasiness in his words. He pulled out
his empty pipe and stuck it between his blackened teeth. Caleb
here appeared with uncouth bundles, and Martha (embellished
by sudden Sunday clothes) with a last frightened chicken, and
as the barge had now quite tautened its window-rope and left a
watery gap, Martha’s descent was a fluttering episode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so easy as the New Jerusalem coming down,” gasped
Caleb, when she was safely installed inside the cart with Maria
and the poultry and the dazed Nip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ephraim Bidlake, intimating he could not wait on this jaunt
to lower any of the furniture, had gone off—in a little dinghy
he carried—to rescue the fowls in the orchard branches, and
their fearful cackling and the excitement of his perilous quest
now drew all eyes, except Jinny’s, which remained furtively bent
on the window, from which the drifting of the barge had carried
her away. It was with relief that she heard Martha suddenly
exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where’s the boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi count he’s got such a mort o’ new-fangled things,” scoffed
Caleb. “Tooth-brushes and underclothes and shavin’-strops—happen
he’ll want a whole portmantle. Oi offered to help him
with his poor arm, but he’s that fiery and sperrited—ye remember,
Jinny, how he lugged his great ole box all the way
Chipstone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s the matter with his arm?” Jinny asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you see his sling?” called Elijah proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Broken?” Jinny murmured, paling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a simple fracture.” He puffed complacently at his
pipe, forgetting it was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to go back, Caleb, and help the poor lad,” said
Martha, with renewed agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you might as well get my hand-bag from my room,”
Elijah added. “I didn’t think of it in the rush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ravens, labouring mightily with his pole to larboard, pushed
the barge back to the window, and as Caleb obediently clambered
in again, Martha, growing calmer, began telling Jinny how Will
had swum out to the stable to save the horses, but had only got
his arm kicked for his pains. And then, of course, he couldn’t help
her in carrying any of her furniture upstairs—it was a mercy he got
back at all—and, it being Sunday, “Flynt” would help only to
save life, though you’d have thought from Maria’s squeals, as she
was haled upstairs, that she was being slaughtered rather than
saved. As for Mr. Skindle, he seemed stricter with the Sabbath
than even the Peculiars, and would do nothing but try to light
the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span> were at home. I hadn’t got but the clothes I stood in,”
Elijah explained. “What should I have done if I’d gone up to
my neck in water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s your bag,” Caleb’s voice broke in from the window,
“but Will won’t come, Martha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t come?” shrilled Martha, and before Jinny could stop
her, she was on the footboard and had disappeared through the
casement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s an ungrateful, ill-tempered fellow,” Elijah commented,
picking up his bag, and changing his collar as he talked. “I
don’t call him a gentleman. He can’t forgive that his arm was
set by a vet., and he sits about like a broody hen. Asked me
not to mention it, which, of course, as a gentleman, I won’t.
What good do you suppose it would do me to have it known—I
said to him—seeing I’ve already got the family connexion with
Maria? But he got very cross,” Elijah wound up innocently,
“though I said I wouldn’t even charge pig’s price, but would
swap the fee and Maria’s too against his horses, provided I could
recover the carcases.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to stay here,” cried Martha, reappearing hysterically
at the window. “He won’t come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nonsense!” cried Jinny, losing her temper. “We’ll
all go and pull him out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s locked himself in my bedroom—the one with the side
window—you can’t get in from here.” She wrung her hands;
these days of durance and danger had evidently told upon her
nerves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll smash the door in and his head too!” growled Ravens,
his foot on the window-sill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” Jinny commanded, swinging herself suddenly past
him. “You take your wife down, Mr. Flynt. She’s too excited.
I’ll rout him out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha protested shrilly that where she had failed, a stranger
could not succeed. No, she must stay with her boy, tend his
poor arm! But the men overruled her and were returning her
gently but firmly to the footboard of the cart when she cried
desperately:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait! Wait! I’ve forgotten something under my pillow.”
“I’ll get it!” Jinny promised. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martha refused to say. It was very precious. It was in
an envelope. It wasn’t for Jinny to see. In vain Jinny declared
she wouldn’t open the envelope. Martha’s hysteric protests
mingled with the frenzied cackling of the fowls that Ephraim
Bidlake was still chasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the males to pacify Martha and deposit her in the
cart, Jinny stooped under the barge-rope and threaded the litter
betwixt the bed and the right-hand door—the other door, she
knew, gave on the bedroom bisected by Frog Cottage. Pausing
but a moment to look down the now literal well of the staircase,
in which dead mice floated, she rapped imperiously at the
connubial chamber under the gable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away, mother!” came the fretful answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not your mother—if I were I’d slap you. A nice state
you’ve got her into!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” he said in a changed tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother’s left something precious in an envelope under
her pillow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you said you’d never cross my doorstep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t—I came by the window-sill.” But even as her lips
gave the obvious repartee, her mind beheld her grandfather
scrambling into the room of the Angel-Mother, and it all seemed
ineffably silly in view of the tragic realities of life. As if she
would not have crossed even an enemy’s threshold to bind up a
broken arm!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, suppose you return the same way,” he retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I mean to do,” she said, angry again. “I’ve
got my rounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! In the barge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want a boat. Long Bradmarsh has kept its head
above water and Methusalem’s going just as strong as before
the flood.” Then, afraid she had recalled his own dead horses,
she added hurriedly: “How’s your arm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s nothing, thank you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not without the envelope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their words came muffled through the door-panels, and a
barrier as obstructive seemed to divide their spirits, though they
yearned dumbly towards each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll put it under the door,” he said surlily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder you’re ashamed to look me in the face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was thinking of his behaviour to his mother. But it
was an unfortunate remark. Will <span class='it'>was</span> ashamed, mortally
ashamed of his defeat. He had come along from over the seas,
he felt, swelling and strutting and jeering! Poor little Jinny!
Poor, comical little village carrier! Oho, he’d soon crush her!
Oho, he’d soon make an end of her! And now! His coach
smashed up, his horses drowned, his capital gone, his savings—the
bulk spent on his fine clothes—barely sufficient to carry him
along while seeking some new employment, even his parents
impoverished by the flood, their very roof perhaps about to
collapse over his head! While she—! Here she was with her
invincible old cart, walking the waters, posing as the saviour of
the whole family, carrying on the postal service and the coach
service, blowing her triumphant trumpet on her immemorial
Tuesday round, her old clients doubly at her mercy! What
humiliation could be more bitter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the worst of it all was that the ache of passion, nourished
by her rejection of his new advances, had become intolerably
poignant. Jinny! Jinny! He seemed to hear it all around
him, Jinny! Jinny! from morning to night—and even all
through the night, floating through his dreams like a strain of
music. And Jinny herself was ever before him night and day,
with her eyes laughing and her tongue stinging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now that she was there in the flesh, with only a door
between them, he felt he could not open it. He must never look
in her face again till he had rehabilitated his fortunes. No word
of love had ever been spoken between them. But could he see
her, stand near her now, and not speak it? And a fine story it
would sound, even if his lips proved spiritless enough to attempt
it. He had loved her from the first moment he had seen her in
the courtyard of “The Black Sheep,” nay, from childhood, and
had tried to steal her business! Had loved her and might have
driven her, with the grandfather she supported, to die in a
ditch! And now that it was he who was in the ditch, could he
come prating of love, add her enhanced scorn to his self-contempt?
No, he had missed his opportunities! A nice hand to
offer her—even if there was any chance of her taking it—a hand
swathed in a sling, symbol of his crippled fortunes! He must
set out on his travels again—that was clear—work his passage—as
soon as his bones had grown together—to those new Australian
goldfields that everybody was talking of, and then, when his
self-respect had grown together too, he would write to her and
ask her to wait for him. And if she still said “No”—or had
already said “Yes” to a better man—why what else had he
deserved, monkeying around with a flirt who was not worthy
even of Elijah!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Jinny now heard him moving speechlessly to get the
envelope, the voice of Ravens carolling the popular “Gipsy
King,” told her that Martha had been quieted down—unlike the
fowls, which were still squawking under Bidlake’s coaxings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she heard Will laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” she called, more brightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well of all the—!” And then an envelope was pushed
under the door. “She hasn’t opened it yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny stooped down. It was the letter from Will that
Martha would not let her read in the Spring of ’51!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she knew what was in it,” said Jinny, her eyes misting.
“And you oughtn’t to laugh at such a proof of love. Nobody
else would call that a precious treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word “love” sent vibrations through them both, despite
the woodwork between.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s money in the others anyhow,” he said, and
three opened envelopes came unexpectedly under the door—the
letters she had just brought to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are these for?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may as well have them—commissions for the coach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For me?” Jinny said, touched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’d be obliged if you helped me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Will!” Her voice was as broken as his pride seemed
to be. But his mood was less of meekness than of self-scourging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you said the coach service had broken down,” he
reminded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mean to twit you—I’m sorry——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for? You told me I’d get stuck and come to you to
pull me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m so sorry, really. Poor Snowdrop! Poor Cherry-blossom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you call it a funeral coach? Good-bye, you’ve got
the treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better come too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t be beholden to the cart if that’s what’s sticking
in your gizzard. You can get off at the dyke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not me. You won’t see me again—not for a long time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish! I can see you now through the keyhole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long as I don’t see you,” he said gruffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll see me before you’re a day older.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bet my bottom dollar I won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A dashing young lad from Canada</span>,” she carolled. “<span class='it'>Once
a great wager did lay—</span> Why have you buried your face in
your hands?” she broke off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t—it’s to shut you out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha! So I do come in all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Loud cries of “Jinny! Jinny!” now intimated, like the silence
of the rescued poultry, that the barge was preparing to cast off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just coming!” she called loudly. “Good-bye, you sullen,
runty idiot. They can’t wait any longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye!” he growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her look was mischievous as she ran off. But that he could
not see: he could only hear the noisy banging of the opposite
door. He had already forgotten his wager. But by hook or
crook she meant to lure him out, if only for an instant. That
was why she came as noisily back and thumped at his door
again. “You can’t be left without food,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my business. Let me be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not till I know you won’t starve. There’s Ravens’ dinner-packet
you can have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it away,” he roared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes twinkled. He had played into her hands, empty as
they were. “I won’t take it away,” she said. There was a
sound as of angry dumping outside his door. Then the opposite
door banged and silence fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment Will, drawing a sigh, half of relief, half of
despair, opened his door and the next moment—he never knew
how it had happened exactly (still less did he realize that there
was no dinner-packet there at all), but since he had only one
arm it seemed to him afterwards it could not be he that had
enfolded her, even if he had done so with his eyes when her merry
mocking face shone so trickily upon the landing, while Jinny
always felt that it was precisely the arm out of action that had
come round her, just as it was his <span class='it'>not</span> coming on a horse that
had made her feel Passion’s force—but there they were (by some
irresistible flood) in each other’s arms, with Jinny’s flower-soft
cheek pressed with a wonderful warmth to his own, and her
silvery little voice crooning: “Oh, my poor Will! Oh, my poor
Will!” He knew immediately that there had been nothing like
this in all his motley experience, nothing at once so pure, so
sweet, so tender. This was the love that lifted, not degraded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jinny, though she had no comparative lore of love and
was all the more absorbed in the absolute wonder, uniqueness
and completeness of it, knew more swiftly than her lover that
this was no time for dallying. In what seemed to him a mere
flash of lightning the whole episode was cruelly over, he was
being helped into the barge, while Bidlake was in his bedroom
untying the rope, and Jinny with motherly zeal and uncanny
knowledge was scrambling together his things for the night.
For her, too, the moment of breaking away had been hard, and
as her face moved from his, it seemed like passing from a sunny
clime to a polar world. But as she now busied herself with his
little equipment, the glow was back again at her heart, and the
transfigured world of that magic moment was hers again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the wherry began to move off at last, and Frog Cottage was
doubled again, Martha, who had been laid snugly inside the cart
surrounded by her live stock, with blankets from the bed thrown
over her, threw them off, stretched her arms to her receding farm
and burst into a new passion of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear heart! Dear heart!” cried Caleb, almost as agitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we ever see our things again?” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s nawthen to cry over, dear heart, even ef we don’t.
We’ve got to thank the Lord for givin’ us the use of Frog Farm
all they long years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martha sobbed on, unconsoled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Will’s been taken from me too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Martha,” Caleb reassured her. “There he is by the
starn, smokin’ his pipe. ’Tis middlin’ clever to my thinkin’ to
fill it one-handed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Martha refused to be comforted. So spasmodic were her
gulpings that Nip set up a sympathetic howl and Maria a perturbed
squeal. But none of these sounds—not even Ravens’
singing—could drown the celestial music Will and Jinny heard
in their hearts.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Jinny’s</span> passage through Long Bradmarsh with her overflowing
freight of fares and live stock was like a triumphal progress. The
loungers outside “The King of Prussia” actually raised a cheer.
Fresh from the excitement of the Mott inquest, they knew the
adventurous significance of her dripping cart-wheels and dry tilt,
and were quick to see the symbolic significance of her carrying
the disabled driver of “The Flynt Flyer,” though its destruction
was still unknown to them. At the instance of Elijah, she went
round by Foxearth Farm, so as to put up Maria and the poultry
there, as well as to reassure Blanche of his safety. Though the
interview with the latter was naturally veiled from the occupants
of the cart, it was obvious to them that it was Mrs. Purley who
was doing the talking. Her voice, wafted to them through walls
which dulled the actual words, was like an endless drone, each
sentence fusing breathlessly into the next in a maddening meaninglessness.
Elijah returned with a dejected mien: due not
merely, it transpired, to the cascade that had broken over
him, but to the fact that Blanche was just washing her head
(that generation did not speak of its hair) and unable to see him.
“As if you hadn’t suffered enough from water,” said Jinny
sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had her first view that day of Mr. Skindle’s bridal mansion.
Its two stories rose in new red brick on the outskirts of Chipstone,
in a forlorn field that was just being “developed,” and its
architecture, from bow-window to chimney-stack, was an imitation
of the residence of Dr. Mint, the leading human doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Rosemary Villa!” said Elijah proudly, and Will
smiled at the recollection of Bundock’s jape and Blanche’s
merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ere Elijah, leaping down first, could mount his beautifully
whitened steps, the door was opened excitedly and a gaunt grey-haired
charwoman, with a smear on her cheek, dropped her grate-blacking
brush and fell upon Elijah’s neck in a spasm of emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God! Thank God!” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! Don’t do that!” said Elijah, writhing in her grasp.
He was blushingly disconcerted by this assertion of maternity
before company: she had so long accepted the position of drudge
that he had forgotten that his absence during the flood might
reawaken the mother. “You’re all black!” he explained,
disentangling himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s mourning for you!” Jinny called merrily from her
cart, and the jest relieved the situation. She looked curiously
at the lank, aproned figure, fancying she caught a hint of grace
in the movement of the limbs and a gleam of fire in the dark
eyes. But this dim sense of the tragic passing of romance
could not even faintly obscure her own happiness, on which the
imminent separation from Will was the only cloud. Except for
the thrilling contact achieved in helping him to alight, she had
to part with him less cordially than with Caleb, who to her
surprise and Martha’s gave her a smacking kiss ere he stepped
down. “Thank you, dearie—ye’ve saved our lives,” he said.
Jinny scoffed at that—the gratitude was due to Bidlake and
Ravens. “Well, the missus’ll have to kiss <span class='it'>them</span>,” he sniggered.
“You do your own kissing,” said Martha sharply. “And keep
your kissing for your own, too.” All this talk of kissing but
aggravated the pang of the frigid parting with the one person
who mattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye; see you soon,” was all Will said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet your bottom dollar on that,” she flashed, with a
relieved smile, reading into his words a promise to come over the
very next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll pay you next time,” he smiled back, and she had a
delicious sense of his meaning to pay his lost wager in the currency
with which Caleb had just acquitted his debt. She promised the
old people she would come round on Friday and tell them how
Frog Farm stood—if it did stand! But though her eyes exchanged
with Will’s secret promises for the morrow, an eternity of loneliness
seemed to lie before her, as she drove back to the town,
magnanimously blowing the “Buy a Broom Polka” to apprise
her faithless clients.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>So many commissions clamoured for her from folk with
relations in the flooded area that she had no difficulty in redeeming
her dress from the pawnshop that very day. But it was not on
account of the many calls upon her that she arrived home in the
dark. It was because she had forgotten to command her faithful
ferry’s attendance, and been forced to take the amazed Methusalem
miles round by the farther bridge. Her grandfather
would be anxious, she feared: then it occurred to her—not
wholly with satisfaction—that he might have followed her day’s
movements by telescope. But she found him as happy as she
had left him, and with the hearth blazing like a bonfire, reckless
of logs. He had not observed her rescue of the Flynts, for, as
she had warned him, his overtaxed right eye had become inflamed
and throbbed with little darts of pain, and he had been compelled
to fall back on the voluptuous venom of his reflections, supplemented
by a text which he had hunted out with his other eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It come into my mind all of an onplunge,” he chuckled,
putting a bony finger on a verse. “<span class='it'>The horse and his rider hath
He thrown into the sea</span>,” she saw with a shudder. “That won’t
be long afore he follows his hoss,” said the Gaffer grimly as he
polished his lens for the spectacle. “Oi will sing to the Lord,”
he read out, “for He hath triumphed gloriously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be so wicked, Gran’fer,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wicked! That’s roighteous—to sing to the Lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t want people drowned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dedn’t he want us to starve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks more like <span class='it'>his</span> starving now. We can afford to forgive.
You’re reading the wrong end of the Bible, Gran’fer. We’ve got
to turn the other cheek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sow Oi would, ef anybody was bussin’ me,” he cackled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny flushed and turned both her cheeks away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the day Oi met Annie at Che’msford Fair——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to hear about Annie,” she said severely. “She
wasn’t your wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why I tarned from iniquity. But she ain’t nobody’s
wife now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, poor thing!” she said. “And it’s a pity she’s Mr.
Skindle’s mother, for he makes her do all the chares of his big
new house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but she’s a woman, ain’t she?” he asked with
unexpected lack of sympathy. “She’d have to do her husband’s
chares.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at <span class='it'>her</span> age!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At <span class='it'>her</span> age? Annie’s a young woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Compared with you, perhaps,” she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Git over me, her having a lad that size. Oi count she’s
worritin’ over him, cooped up in Frog Farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now. They’re all safely out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! That pirate thief’s got safe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t God’s doin’—that’s some evil interferin’ sperrit
what comes out o’ dead bodies, says John Wesley. Who took
’em off?” he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They came off in Bidlake’s barge,” she said weakly. “And
don’t you be so unchristian. Isn’t it enough he’s——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t right, interferin’ with the texts!” he interrupted
doggedly. “Oi never could abide they Bidlakes. Ephraim’s
grandfather come competitioning on the canals, wuss than
Willie Flynt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Flynt can’t competition any more, can he? I
expect,” she added with difficult lightness, “he’ll be coming
round now to make friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come round, will he? Just let him show his carroty head
inside my doorway—he’ll be outside like fleck, Oi promise ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if he wants to make it up——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got to goo down on his hands and knees fust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he will,” she suggested. Indeed she had little
doubt of it. That wonderful moment, with its climax of mouth
to mouth, had reduced this long foreseen obstacle to a grotesque
bogy. In the light of mutual and confessed love the perspective
changed, and if she had once thought that she could not have
borne to see him grovel even for her sake, that it would actually
impair the love grovelled for, she had now been uplifted into a
plane of existence in which for him <span class='it'>not</span> to humour her grandfather
seemed as childish as the nonagenarian’s own demand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man now turned on her a red-rimmed probing eye.
“He’d never come crawlin’ to me ef he warn’t arter summat.
And he’s been tryin’ to git round you fust—don’t tell me!
What’s his game?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps—he’d like—a partnership.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi dessay he would!” he chuckled ironically. “He’s got
brass enough for anythin’. Why, the chap was arter <span class='it'>you</span> once.
Ye dedn’t know it, but there ain’t much hid from Daniel Quarles.
Oi suspicioned him the fust moment he come gawmin’ to the
stable. And what’ll he bring to the pardnership? Cat’s-meat
and matchwood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His coarseness jarred every nerve, but she kept to his key of
jocosity. “Didn’t you say he had brass?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He, he, he!” he cackled. “But it’s the wrong kind o’
brass. Ef he wanted to be a pardner, why dedn’t he come when
he had his coach and hosses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he?” he said blankly. “Then why dedn’t Oi take
’em?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was all my fault, Gran’fer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it warn’t, dearie. It was ’cause he said Oi’d made
muddles. Oi remember now. He come and swabbled, and
chucked a pot at me. And he’s got to goo down on his hands
and knees for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny saw it was hopeless to unravel these blended memories
of Will and Elijah, as grotesquely interwoven as one of her own
nightmares, on whose formation it seemed to throw light. She
was glad, though, that the sharp edges of the actuality had now
faded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes—he shall,” she promised soothingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then there was that weddin’-cake what Mr. Flippance
sent us,” burst up now from the labouring depths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—wasn’t that a lovely cake?” she agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi offered him a shiver—shows ’twarn’t me as wanted to
swabble. But he lifted his whip at me and Oi snapped it in two
like my ole pipe when John Wesley stopped my smokin’. Oi
don’t want no pardnerships.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not, Gran’fer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daniel Quarles it’s been for a hundred year, and Daniel
Quarles it’s a-gooin’ to remain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Daniel Quarles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he’s got to goo down on his hands and knees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so have I,” she laughed, “for we’ve let our bonfire die
down. Poor Mr. Flynt—he’s got a great admiration for you,
spite that you’ve licked him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi guessed you and him been gammickin’. You can’t hide
much from Daniel Quarles. And ef that little Willie has got a
proper respect for his elders and betters, that shows Oi larnt him
a lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did, Gran’fer. He’s a changed man. There! Isn’t
that a nice blaze again? He’s broken his right arm, too, poor
fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here she had blundered. The old man’s face lit up, not
from the fire, but with a roaring flame of its own. “Thank the
Lord,” he shouted, “as hears the prayer of the humble. The
high arm shall be broken, says the Book, and it’s come true.
The arm what dreft the hosses is broken like the coach!” He
ended with a fresh cackle and rubbed his skinny hands before
the blaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t pray for that?” said Jinny, white and rebuking.
“That was unchristian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what King David prayed, Jinny, and he was a man
after God’s own heart. ‘Break thou the arm of the wicked’—Oi’ll
show it you in the Psalm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to see it—King David wasn’t a Christian yet.
And we’ve got to forgive and forget, and not bear a grudge
for ever, especially when a man’s down. Think of John
Wesley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happen you’re right, Jinny,” he said, softening. “We’ve
got to forgive the evil-doer, and ef the Lord’s got him in hand
Oi count we needn’t trouble—he’ll git all he desarves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with that Jinny felt fairly content.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But though the ground was thus prepared for his advent, Will
did not come. “What are you prinkin’ yourself for?” her
grandfather asked in the morning. “It ain’t your day.” It
was certainly not her day. It was more like a night—a long
agony of expectation with every rustle of wind on the dead leaves
sounding like his footstep. Towards dusk she even swept the
water-logged landscape with the now neglected telescope. If she
did not find him, she found—what was almost as soothing—a
reason for his not coming. The broken bridge! How could he
go all those miles round? Joyfully she called herself a fool, and
awaited the letter he would send instead. The letter would fill
up the Thursday and on the Friday she would go to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even this milder expectation of a visit from Bundock went
unfulfilled. At first she thought with some relief that Bundock
was again shirking the circuit. But no! The glass revealed the
slave of duty serving Beacon Chimneys. Throwing on her jacket,
but bonnetless, she ran across the Common to meet her letter.
But Bundock only gave her grumbles at the overstrain on his
feet, and leaving him, to hide her dismay, she walked blindly up
Beacon Hill till she was startled to come upon Master Peartree
in the bosom of his new-born flock. It did not even occur to
her that this was a proof he had escaped the flood, and that the
occasion called for congratulation. But the sight of his lambs
bounding and his ewes scooping out mangolds brought to mind
his old account of a sheep that had broken its arm “in a roosh,”
and at once a second rush of joy at her silliness and a still more
paradoxical pleasure in Will’s broken arm flooded her soul.
How <span class='it'>could</span> he write, the poor boy? It was not that she had
really forgotten the state of his arm—indeed, she had thought
of the sling as clogging the springiness of his walk, and making
it still more impossible for him to come—only she must be going
crazy again, she felt; just as in the days when she had taken
home wedding-cakes and brought Elijah hairpins. Her eyes now
filled with happy tears and, joyous as the yeanlings whose tails
vibrated with such voluptuous velocity as they sucked, she gave
chase to a little black lamb and kissed its sable nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That brought her thoughts back to the flood by way of Mother
Gander’s hostelry and its drowned landlord, and she inquired at
last about Master Peartree’s losses. They had been limited to
one bullock, she was glad to hear, though no such glow of Christian
feeling possessed her as she had recommended to her grandfather,
when the shepherd-cowman proceeded to estimate that what
with stacks, root-crops, and winter-wheat, Farmer Gale was the
poorer by several thousand pounds. Other shepherds had been
badly hit, but he himself—thanks to the Almighty—had got
more twins and triplets than ever, and taking her round his
<span class='it'>plaza</span> of straw he showed her the yellow-splashed, long-legged
lambkins in the thatched pens, one set of which he would have
to feed by bottle, for handsome mothers did not give the most
milk, he moralized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran homewards as full of the joy of life as the leaping
lambs, though she was living only for the morrow. Through the
frosty air she felt a first breath of spring, birds were singing, and
even beginning to build, and the flood, she was sure, was falling.
But when next day she reached Rosemary Villa, the gaunt
drudge informed her that only the old Flynts were in! Her
heart turned to lead. So he had not stayed in for her, though
she, for her part, had raced to him by the shortest routes, irrespective
of business, cutting through Chipstone proper by a single
side-street. It was not till she had learnt that he was gone, like
Elijah and all the world, to Mr. Mott’s funeral, that her heart
grew light again—she seemed to batten on tragedies these days.
Of course Will could not avoid this mark of respect, he who had
always put up his coach in the courtyard of “The Black Sheep,”
and perhaps she ought to have gone to the funeral too, and
would probably have encountered it had she not skipped the
High Street in her eagerness. She remembered now some
lowered blinds in the street she had scuttled through, and a slow
booming bell, whose disregarded notes now at last donged their
message to her brain. But perhaps it was better so—her
redeemed frock was too gay, her winter shawl and bonnet
without a single touch of black. She ought to have borne the
inevitable funeral in mind though, she told herself reproachfully.
In her present guise she could hardly station even in the courtyard.
It was fortunate “Mother Gander” no longer expected
to see her within. How embarrassing it would have been for
the widow to meet the confidante of her unmeasured denunciations!
Probably the whole place would be closed for the day,
though she supposed the Chelmsford coach with the passengers
from London would have to come in as usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apprised by the barking of Nip, the Flynt couple had descended,
looking uneasy, for they had been speaking of her not
long before. Their hostess-drudge had started the ball as she
closed the door upon Will, outward bound for the funeral.
“You’d think he’d found a fortune, not lost one,” the melancholy
creature had commented, warmed by that youthful sunshine.
“I reckon he wasn’t happy hartin’ Jinny’s business,” Caleb had
surmised. “And to be happy is as good as a fortune.” Upon
which Martha, who was equally in the passage “to see Will off,”
had surprised them by a sudden sob. “She’s thinkin’ of that
poor drownded young man,” Caleb had apologized, leading her
gently upstairs. “Oi do hope Will’ll keep a proper face for the
funeral.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That appropriate face, however, had continued to be Martha’s,
and the explanation thereof when they were alone had surprised
Caleb more than the sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew she’d rob me of Will. I knew it from the first
moment she wanted to read his letter to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rob you of him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re in love. Are you blind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say! Lord! Little Jinny! Why, she’s a baiby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cunning woman. Came after him even when you’d have
thought he was safe behind the flood! This letter will be all
that’s left to me! You mark my words!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, dear heart. You’re wettin’ the letter—it’ll spile.
But dedn’t Oi leave my mother to come to you, as the Book
commands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s different. He’s all I’ve got. I can’t trust him to
Jinny—she’s too flighty—always singing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sow’s the birds, but look what noice nests they make!
’Tain’t as if ’twas that Purley gal as Bundock warned us of, allus
lookin’ at herself like a goose in a pond. We ought to be thankful
as Will’s showed sow much sense. There’s plenty o’ good farmers
along the road, but there’s no weeds to Jinny even three fields
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder you go kissing her! Pity you can’t marry
her yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’d have no chance agin Will’s looks, dear heart. He
takes arter his mother, ye see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dulcifying as this jocose finale had proved, it did not diminish
the awkwardness of now meeting Jinny, but Martha, who had
not even the consolation of finding an Ecclesia flourishing in
Chipstone, was anxious to hear how far the flood had subsided
from their beloved Frog Farm. They were both experiencing
all the pangs of exile, aggravated by the discomforts of a house
with monotonously boarded floors, forbiddingly fine furniture,
and light and water coming unnaturally out of taps, and their
grievances and yearnings for a return to reality now monopolized
a conversation which Jinny strove in vain to divert to Will. She
was reduced to looking at her cart for indications of the depths
she had splashed through unobservantly, and could extract
nothing about Will except that he insisted on paying for their
board and lodging, and that this would surely take his last penny.
“He’ll have to look for a job now, he’ll have no time or money
to think of foolishness,” Martha told her meaningly. But this
broad hint conveyed nothing to her. In her affection for the
old woman it never occurred to her that she would not make a
welcome daughter-in-law, now the competition was over. And
knowing as a scientific fact that your ears burned if people had been
talking of you—whereas hers had been tingling with the frost—she
went away, all unsuspicious, in quest of the coveted young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The funeral was over now, she saw from the many coaches
returning singly or in procession through and from the High
Street. Surely the grandest funeral ever known (she thought),
doubtless out of consideration for so tragic a passing, though
somewhat confusing to the moral of her Spelling-Book. Elijah,
whom she met changing from a coach into his trap, confirmed
her impression of grandeur, and looked forward—on grounds of
special information—to the toning up of the churchyard with a
monument as big as money could buy, surmounted by angels,
“not weeping, mind you, but blowing trumpets like Will’s.”
Elijah wore a beautiful new top-hat, flat-brimmed and funereally
braided. “Very lucky I had just got it for my wedding,” he
confided to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t forget to take off the braid?” she smiled. “And
when is it to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re having the banns read next Sunday. Blanche won’t
wait a day longer, though I’m so frightfully busy through the
flood—it’s a regular gold-stream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how’s Mr. Flynt’s arm?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t let me see it now—I never knew such an obstinate
pig. He’s gone to Dr. Mint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, just now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, he’s gone home—to Rosemary Villa, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he was out of sight, Jinny turned Methusalem’s head
back to the Villa. She hung about uncomfortably for some
minutes in the thought that Will might be coming along or would
be looking out of a window. But after ten unpleasant minutes
she descended from her seat and fumbled shyly with the new
brass knocker, feeling far more brazen than it. She almost
cowered before the upstanding figure of the septuagenarian Mrs.
Skindle—it vaguely reminded her of Britannia with a broom—but
stammering out that she had forgotten to ask if the Villa
needed anything, she ascertained that Will had not returned.
To pitch her cart at the door was impossible, to go to meet him
might lead to missing him, so there was nothing for it but desperately
to prolong the conversation till he should reach home.
Her tactics proved fatal, for her cheerful reference to Elijah’s
coming marriage loosed upon her a deluge of hysterical tears,
and she found herself the confidante of sorrows as tragic as Mrs.
Mott’s. Poor Mrs. Skindle, throwing herself upon this sympathetic
outsider, so providential a vent for her surcharged emotions,
vociferated that all her children had abandoned her, that she
was to be put away in the poorhouse. In vain Jinny, standing
in that bleak passage, her heart astrain for Will’s coming, strove
to assuage a grief which irritated rather than touched her. She
could hardly bring her mind to bear upon this creature with the
broom, so inopportune and irrelevant did the outburst seem, so
sordid a shadow on her own romance. With surface words she
assured the poor woman that all this was only in her imagination.
But Mrs. Skindle, though admitting she had only divined it,
kept iterating that a nod was as good as a wink, and that she
wasn’t even a blind horse. Her son had gone to see Blanche on
the Wednesday and had come back with the announcement of
his marriage next month, and Blanche had made it a condition
that his old mother should be put away. “She’d pison me, if
she wasn’t afraid for her swan’s neck. And so I’ve got to be
put out o’ sight. ’Tain’t as if I can’t earn my bread with this
broom and duster, but she’s too grand to have me charin’ in
Chipstone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, what prevents you going somewhere else?”
Jinny asked impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t go traipsin’ about to new places and new faces at my
age. And I don’t want to go agin ’Lijah neither—he ought to
ha’ been married long since, and wasn’t it me spurred him on
to look that high? And won’t he have the loveliest wife in
Chipstone? What’s your game, trying to drive me away?
Why, if I leave Chipstone I’d never see my grandchicks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but would you see them anyhow, even supposing
they’re hatched?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon there’s days I’d be allowed out and I could see ’em
as they went by in their baby-cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, at that rate you’d be happier in the poorhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” with a burst of weeping, “I’d be happier there.
Happen I’d better go there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t believe your son will let you,” Jinny reassured
her, and tore herself away, miserably conscious of a sort of
Nemesis for her strategic lingering. She dismissed the scene from
her mind. But it added to the heaviness of her heart as she
drove slowly about the streets with never a glimpse of the face
she sought, and the ache of his absence began to be complicated
by the fear that it was wilful, or at least not unavoidable. Surely
it was not possible for three days to elapse without their meeting,
had he been as keen as she. Even the funeral, she now felt
grimly, was not an absolute necessity of life! He could have
got out of it. No, there was something behind, more sinister
than funerals. She went anxiously over her one brief episode
of happiness. Had she done or said anything to offend him?
Was it that, on reflection, he had resented the little trick she had
played at the flooded farm in luring him outside his door? Yes,
that must be it. And she had sillily rubbed it in with her last
words: “You bet your bottom dollar on that!” But no, he
could hardly be resenting the innocent device without which
they would never have known the wonder of their first kiss. The
wonder? But was it a wonder to <span class='it'>him</span>? Tumultuous thoughts
of Blanche and more shadowy others tore at her bosom. He did
not really care, did not really need her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sport of elemental passions, she drove vaguely around,
hoping against hope to espy him. She was a creature of pure
feeling—unsophisticated by fiction or drama—and darkling
images of death came to her for the first time. And for the first
time she let her work go undone. It was no mere apprehension
of meeting “Mother Gander” that finally kept her from the
courtyard of the inn, no mere sense that with the sweeping
away of competition she could afford to neglect for once even
the commissions she already held; it was the absolute distraction
of her mind. She could have borne final separation more easily
than this uncertainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she jogged home, she realized miserably that Will had at
last succeeded in stamping out her business, if only for a day.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But on her way to church on the Sunday—thanksgiving was
clearly due for her restored fortunes and the fast-falling flood—all
her misery, which his Saturday silence had only intensified,
melted away in a moment at the sound of his voice and the sight
of his sling. To add to her rapture came the thought that, a
turning later, she would have encountered Miss Gentry! But his
exclamation: “Why, whatever became of you, Jinny? It’s
been hell!” radiated so much heaven that the closing of his lips
upon hers was almost a retrogression, perturbed as it was by her
shyness in the open air. And, of course, she ought to have gone
to the inn-yard where he had been waiting, she saw the moment
he began explaining; that was the natural station for her cart to
have come to. “Do forgive me making you suffer so,” she pleaded.
“But I didn’t like to go in, with Mrs. Mott in that state!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Mott had not been “in that state” he corrected
almost laughingly. On the contrary, with her usual unexpectedness
and extremism, she had reopened the bar immediately and
served there herself in her handsomest dress, with the gold chain
heaving once more on the bereaved bosom. Will himself had
been forced to clink glasses with her. “He wouldn’t have liked
to see us gloomy—like them Peculiars,” she had said. “He was
always one for jollity and life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anecdote enhanced the lovers’ own joy of life, and though
Jinny steered for church (if by a zigzag path to avoid other
worshippers) they never got out of the fir-grove, where a tree
sapped by the flood presented a comparatively dry seat amid
the sodden gull-haunted ways. Perhaps it was the thrushes that
encouraged them—despite the dankness—to “stick to it, stick
to it.” It was certainly more comfortable for kissing, Jinny shamelessly
confessed, snuggling into the cloak he had bought to cover
his sling. “When we stand up, you’re too proud to stoop,” she
laughed blissfully. “You make me crane my neck up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s only through the sling,” he apologized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind—you’re not such a Goliath—nothing so tall as
Elijah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes blazed fiercely. “Why,” she laughed, “you don’t
mind not being tall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” he said mendaciously. “Only you haven’t
been measuring yourself against Elijah, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Measuring myself—?” she began, puzzled. Then her silvery
laugh rippled out. “Oh, you jealous goose! But his size’ll be a
bit awkward for Blanche, won’t it?” Then a sudden memory
flushed both their faces, and hastily drawing a copy of the
<span class='it'>Chelmsford Chronicle</span> from his pocket, he directed her attention
to the thrilling accounts of the great flood and the greater funeral,
and her fitful attempts to peruse them constituted the only
rational moments of the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was odd how the reflection of events in the mighty Essex
organ seemed to redouble their importance, and how even Will
swelled in Jinny’s eyes when she saw him catalogued among
“leading citizens” present at “the last obsequies of the popular
proprietor of ‘The Black Sheep.’ ” And if Will failed to loom
as large as Charley—whose death, fortunate in its journalistic
opportunity, instead of being swamped by the flood, came as
its climax—nevertheless he appeared in print no fewer than three
times. The second occasion was the destruction of “The Flynt
Flyer,” and this obituary was so long and complimentary that
it almost made amends for his loss, even though he knew the
details to be highly imaginative. In the third notice he owed
his eminence to his father, who, Jinny learned with surprise, had
been the beneficiary of a miracle. “Among the most singular
of the effects produced by the Bradmarsh floods,” ran the paragraph
that drew Caleb from the long obscurity of his seventy
winters and which was as prolix and breathless as a sentence of
Mrs. Purley’s, “may be cited the fact of a small cornstack some
four yards long, recognized by a shepherd named Peartree as
belonging to Mr. Caleb Flynt, of Frog Farm, father of Mr. William
Flynt, the lamentable destruction of whose coach and horses
under sensational circumstances is recorded in another column,
having been lifted from its place by the waters that so suddenly
burst upon this remote homestead; and, after floating about
at their mercy, like a dismasted and rudderless ship, being
deposited in safety in a higher field, wholly uninjured, save by
the wet—in as firm and compact a condition as before the flood—and,
apparently, without a single blade of straw in its body or
its roof having been disturbed from its relative position, while
other stacks in the same field, belonging to his former employer,
Farmer Gale, were almost totally ruined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Will, I’m so glad,” said Jinny. “I don’t mean about
Farmer Gale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do. Mean hunks! Think what he paid dad all those
years. But is it true about our stack, I wonder. Papers aren’t
always correct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t they?” She nestled closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear no. You should have been in America! Haven’t
you noticed it says Elijah rescued us? Such a mix-up with his
housing us. That’s why I didn’t tell poor old dad till I could
run up and see for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved back. “Oh, is that what you came for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not, darling. But being here, I may as well have
a look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ll be able to, while I’m at church. I suppose you
wouldn’t come,” she added shyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Church?” he laughed. “Why, it’s nearly over!” He
pointed to a pale, struggling sun that had well passed its zenith.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fallow was, in fact, just at his Fifthly and Finally, with
Nip for sole representative of Blackwater Hall. That faithful
congregant, discovering that Jinny had dodged him as usual,
had set out for church forthwith, and was utterly disconcerted
to find her pew vacant. It was noted, however, that he remained
awake during the sermon, pricking up his ears at the recurrent
word “Methuselah,” which no doubt sounded to him like his
old companion’s name. Mr. Fallow’s timely sermon on Noah’s
Flood proved no less rousing to the human hearers, though it
began unpromisingly with the text: “And all the days of
Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he
died.” But Miss Gentry, already ruffled by Jinny’s absence,
wondered why so much honour should be done to Mr. Bundock
“Why preach a sermon against a postman?” she asked Jinny
afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact was, of course, that those “sceptical sophisms” which
Mr. Fallow took the opportunity to traverse and confute came
from “The Age of Reason,” but as Miss Gentry had heard them
only from Bundock, she did not know they were inspired by Tom
Paine. At any rate it was satisfactory to have them demolished
and the veracity of the Bible vindicated by the very arithmetical
tests with which the atheists juggled. They had “set the story
of Noah and his ark as on a level with the ”Arabian Nights“
and the ages of the Patriarchs as no less fabulous than the
immortality of the giants of mythology.” Well, but here was
the text, Mr. Fallow thundered: “And all the days of Methuselah
were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.”
A statement splendidly bare—bare as Truth alone could afford
to be. But let them follow it, these dear brethren and sisters,
into all its ramifications, trace the scattered threads of chronology
and exhibit their marvellous congruity. Noah’s grandfather
lived nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died. But
at the age of 187 he had begotten Lamech, and at the age of 182
Lamech had begotten Noah. Methuselah was then just 369
years old when the hero of the Flood was born. And the Flood
came, we were told in a later chapter, in the six hundredth year
of Noah’s life; 600 added to 369 made 969. “And all the days
of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he
died.” Had the figures made 970, the Bible would have indeed
ceased to be the infallible Word of God, and atheism could
have crowed, unanswered. For Methuselah was not in the ark;
and every living creature outside was destroyed from the
earth!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether he himself perished in the Flood, or whether—as the
preacher preferred to believe, the aged patriarch had been
removed—like his father Enoch before him—from the evil to
come, was a minor issue compared with the glorious certainty
that 369 added to 600 made 969 and not 970. Had Lamech or
Noah been begotten one year later, or the Flood recorded as one
year earlier, what a catastrophe for mankind! How the sophists
would have gloated over their perverse arithmetic! Happily
such discrepancies were the mere dream of the impious. “And
all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine
years; and he died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nip refused to sit through the prayer for sceptics that followed.
With the cessation of the word “Methuselah” his interest
waned, and the dismal conviction overcame him that Jinny had
gone back to the chapel. Tearing off at a great rate, he soon,
however, scented the truants homing across the Common.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, where have <span class='it'>you</span> been?” said his mistress, as if <span class='it'>he</span> were
the sinner!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his raptures at seeing united at last the twain he had done
so much to bring together, served to suspend a debate that had
brought the first cloud on the morning’s happiness. Having to
walk smartly to Blackwater Hall with no time for dalliance, they
had come at last to a serious talk about their plans, and it
transpired that Will’s mind was playing about the new Australian
goldfields. He seemed dangerously in the grip of the “yellow
fever,” which, spreading from a Mr. Hargreaves and Summer
Hill Creek, had circled the world in less than nine months. He
recited to Jinny the legends of the new diggings, the quartz that
was three-fourths gold, the aureous streams, the nuggets the size
of melons. When he spoke of purchasing shovels and blankets,
it was not, alas, for their joint home, nor were the “cradles” of
his conversation indelicately domestic. How <span class='it'>could</span> he talk of
going away, she asked, with tears in her eyes, when they had
only just got to know each other? Well, of course, he didn’t
mean to-morrow, with his arm like that! She needn’t begin to
cry yet, but obviously this hidebound old England was no place
for a man without capital. Did she expect him to become a farmhand
to Farmer Gale? Of course he could go on shearing sheep
and doing odd jobs and sink into a Ravens, always singing, with
nothing to sing about! But if they were to marry, he must find
a decent livelihood. Hard, irrefutable truths! If only—she
thought—they had both been less silly while he still had his
coach and horses! Impossible to suggest to a man like Will
that she might manage to earn enough for him as well as for her
grandfather! Of course if he had lost his arm altogether—but
that was too wicked a speculation to gloat over! Had Methusalem
been younger and stronger, the cart might perhaps have taken
on extra rounds, with Will in command. But even that would
probably have jarred his pride. No, he was a ruined man, and
adventure—as he truly urged—was his only chance. And yet
she clung tighter to his one good arm, glad of the respite the
other had given her, and hoping that the Angel-Mother would
somehow intervene to keep him in the country—if not the
county—she hovered over. Sufficient for the day was the good
thereof; here was Will, and Nip, and the Sunday pie in the
oven—the first good dinner since Christmas, the preparation of
which for her lip-smacking elder had served to keep her sane
during those days of torturing suspense. How glad she was the
meal would be worthy of their visitor!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint uneasiness did indeed begin to creep under her happiness
as they crossed the rutted road that divided the Common
from her gate, but she was hardly conscious what it was, vaguely
putting it down to Nip’s dangerous attempts to caress them
with his muddy paws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we are!” she cried gaily. “Lucky Gran’fer never asks
about the sermon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew her to him. Hurriedly ascertaining that there was
no eye or telescope bearing upon her, she submitted to the long
ardour of his kiss. Then she drew him in turn towards the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve kissed you good-bye,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye?” she repeated blankly. “Aren’t you coming
in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even then she hardly realized the situation. Foreseen as it
had long been, it had so softened in her own mind—especially
after her comparative success in soothing down her grandfather—that
she did not realize it remained in Will’s in all its original
crudity. “You’re not thinking of that nonsense!” she said,
smiling. “We’ll just lift up the latch and walk in! Won’t
Gran’fer be surprised?” But her smile was uneasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve forgotten, Jinny, he won’t have me over his doorstep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is that the reason you didn’t come all the week?” The
greyness creeping beneath her happiness began to spread out
like a clammy fog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how could I have got to you? I couldn’t stand about
the Common in the wind and rain on the chance you might
catch sight of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have stood about for you,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And didn’t I stand about at ‘The Black Sheep’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that was my fault, sweetheart. But anyhow we won’t
stand about here.” And she tugged at his arm. “Where else
could you have dinner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can get some at ‘The King of Prussia.’ I’ll be just in
time if I go now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You desert me to get dinner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that’s nonsense, dearest, considering I could get
both if I came in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why don’t you come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because of those few high words? How absurd!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We won’t go into that now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we will. You don’t want to eat humble pie. But it
isn’t humble pie,” she laughed, with a desperate attempt at
merriment, “it’s steak and kidney pie! So there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Jinny, he forbade me to cross his sill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You old goose! He never thought we’d cross it arm in arm.
Like this! Come along—won’t he open his eyes and wipe his
spectacles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook off her arm. “It’s no laughing matter, Jinny. An
oath is an oath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An oath!” she repeated dully. The violence of that
grotesque collision had blurred her memory of its minutiæ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t have forgotten? He laid his hand on the Bible—he
vowed to the Almighty I should never cross your threshold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She essayed a last jaunty smile. “Unless on your hands and
knees. Don’t forget that part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it likely I could forget such an insult?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then, that’s all right!” Her smile became braver.
“We’ll crawl in together, two little babies. Come along, petsy.”
And she stooped down comically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you be so childish, Jinny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it all childish? Down you go, Willie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he stiffened himself physically as well as morally. “Give
in to such a humiliation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t really be giving in,” she said, with a happy thought.
“With only one arm, you can only come in on your <span class='it'>hand</span> and
knees. So you’ll outwit him after all. Come along, poor little
lopsided creature, Jinny’ll help you—and Gran’fer will forget to
count your limbs, my poor brave boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s you that are forgetting,” he said harshly. “It’s
impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s impossible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I should crawl to your grandfather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see! It’s your pride you love, not me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is.” She snatched her hand from his. “Nothing
can bring you to your knees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not true. I’d go on my hands and knees to you, as if I
was in chapel, and I’d crawl on ’em across your threshold and
thank God for what laid on t’other side—but you see, Jinny,
what breaks me up is that <span class='it'>I</span> made a vow too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t seem to remember anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say I was a bit dazed at all the silliness. But if <span class='it'>you</span>
swore too not to cross our threshold, why, I’ll go and let you in
by the lattice. And perhaps Gran’fer will be that tickled, he’ll
laugh and forget about his cranky old oath. Or perhaps he’ll
reckon you <span class='it'>have</span> scrambled in on your hands and knees. Oh
dear, isn’t it funny? See you in a moment, Will.” She put
her hand on the latch of the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “Neither by door nor by window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I say I’d never cross <span class='it'>your</span> doorstep?” she urged.
“And yet I came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You came through the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll come by the door. There! That’s a fair offer.
I’m not going to stick to silliness—when it’s so silly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All very well,” he said coldly. “But you know you can’t
get through my door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness gracious! Have I grown so fat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t pretend. You know it’s the flood. Besides, it
wouldn’t be any good my going through the window. What I
said when I raised my hand to heaven was that your grandfather
should never <span class='it'>see</span> me in his house——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what <span class='it'>I</span> said—I remember now,” she interrupted. “I
said you’d never see <span class='it'>me</span> in Frog Farm. And yet you did—and
lost your bet too.” Her face was gay again. “So I gave in
first, you see, sweetheart, and now you’ve got to play fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t listen—you cut into my words. What I swore
was that your grandfather should never see me in his house
unless he carried me in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her gaiety grew hysterical. “Ha, ha, ha!” she laughed.
“Grandfather’s given up carrying ages ago. I’m his deputy
now. Oh dear!” She measured him with a rueful eye. “Well,
I can but try!” And she put her arms round his hips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t make light of an oath, Jinny.” He pushed her off
with his left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twas you that made light of an oath—taking the Lord’s
name over trifles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never took the Lord’s name,” he said sullenly. “I only
lifted my hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can’t lift it now—and serve you right! You
surely never expected Gran’fer to lug a sulky lout over his
doorstep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not. I never expected I’d <span class='it'>want</span> to cross it. Why,
Jinny, though you were there in the room, I was that blind——!”
And his hand sought hers again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me alone!” she cried. “You and your miserable
vows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d cut my tongue out if I could unsay the words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can unsay ’em more easily with your tongue in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man can’t go back on his sworn word. Women don’t
understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you said about horses. And nicely you managed yours!
Oh, forgive me, I didn’t mean to crow. That was your misfortune.
But this is your fault. It’s your pride you’re in love
with; not me. Good-bye; Gran’fer will be starving.” She lifted
the gate-latch angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But only good-bye for the moment,” he pleaded. “I can’t
cross your threshold, but you can cross mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered more gently, but her tone was tired and helpless.
“And what would be the good, unless you and Gran’fer make
it up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not marrying your grandfather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something patronizing in the sentence jarred afresh. “You’d
better go back to Blanche—it’ll be too late soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t touch Blanche with Bidlake’s barge-pole!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The magnificence of the repudiation had its effect—it swamped
in both the recollection that it was Blanche who had done the
refusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t expect me to give up Gran’fer at <span class='it'>his</span> age?” she
said more mildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get him a minder—when I come back from Australia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Australia put the climax to her weariness. “Oh, yes, I don’t
wonder it’s so easy for you to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t easy for me to go, even as far as Chipstone,” he
protested passionately. “But it’s your grandfather you love,
not me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you both. Only think how old he is. It’s like
quarrelling with a child. And he <span class='it'>is</span> in his second childhood
almost, though I wouldn’t say it to anybody else. There are
times when he seems quite his old self, wonderfully strong and
sensible, but there are moments when he quite frightens me. He
can’t bear to be crossed, and he forgets almost everything that
happens nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then perhaps he’s forgotten our upset!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that’s the unfortunate part. But we must just make a
little joke of it. Down on your marrow-bones, Willie!” And
she laid her hand on his shoulder with a last sprightly effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even as his shoulder subsided, it swelled up again, like a
pressed gutta-percha ball. “It’s all grandfather with you, your
husband doesn’t count.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Husband, indeed!” She withdrew her hand as if stung.
“You’re going quicker than your coach ever went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well—I’m off to Australia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you please. I’ll call for your box!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have no truck with a cart of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no other way of getting things to Chipstone,” she
reminded him blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll shoulder it sooner,” he burst forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, then you won’t be going just yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn my arm! I’ll not stay in this wretched country
another fortnight! I’ll never look on your face again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began humming: “<span class='it'>A dashing young man from
Canada——!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face grew black with anger, and he strode away even
before she had passed through the gate.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Righteous resentment saved Jinny from the collapse of the
previous week. That dreadful gnawing of uncertainty was over.
Whatever she had said, she was sure now that he did love her,
even if she came second to his pride. That a way out of their
difficulties would soon present itself to her nimble brain she did
not doubt: her one fear was that he would find the way to
Australia first, and it was a comfort to remember his helpless
arm and his empty purse—“no money to think of foolishness,”
as his dear old mother had put it. Already on the Tuesday
after the unheard sermon, she found a means of communicating
with him without a lowering of her own proper pride. For the
fourteenth of the month was nigh upon them, and the shops—even
apart from the stationer’s—-were ablaze with valentines, a
few sentimental, but the overwhelming majority grotesque and
flamboyant, the British version of Carnival. After long search
she discovered a caricature that not only resembled Will in
having carroty locks, but carried in its motto sufficient allusiveness
to the quarrel with her grandfather to make it clear the
overture came from her. Not that the overture looked conciliatory
to the superficial eye. Quite the contrary. For apart
from the ugliness of the visage, the legend ran:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>To such a man I’d never pledge my troth,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>I’d sooner die, I take my Bible oath.</span></p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Not a very refined couplet or procedure perhaps, but Jinny
was never a drawing-room heroine, and the valentine was dear
to the great heart of the Victorian people. Besides, do not the
grandest dames relax at Carnival?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny half expected a similar insult from Will by the same
post, and though St. Valentine’s Day passed without bringing
her one, she still expected a retort in kind the day after. And
when Bundock appeared with a voluminous letter, directed
simply to “Jinny the Carrier, Little Bradmarsh, England,” her
disappointment at Mr. Flippance’s flabby handwriting was acute,
though otherwise she would have been excited, not only by his
letter, but by the foreign stamp, the first she had ever received.
“So he’s still in Boulogne,” Bundock observed casually, lingering
to pick up the contents. “I hope he’s sending you the money
to pay Mrs. Purley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should he send it through me?” she said sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, since he’s writing to you, it would save stamps, wouldn’t
it? I do think it was rough on Mrs. Purley, though, a wedding
breakfast like that, though I expect he bought his own champagne—and
clinking stuff it was, nigh as good as the sherry at
poor Charley’s funeral. However, she’s marrying her own
daughter now—Mrs. Purley, I mean—and lucky she is too to
have escaped young Flynt, who is off to Australia without a
penny—looks to me almost as if they’re hurrying on the marriage
so that Will may be best man before he goes, he and ’Lijah are
that thick! He, he, he! Funny world, ain’t it? You’ve
heard my riddle perhaps—Why are marriages never a success?
Because the bride never marries the best man! He, he! Well,
she came near doing it this time—he, he, he! Though whether
she’s the best woman for either of ’em is a question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s their own business,” Jinny managed to put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So ’tis, but with ’Lijah a member of the Chipstone Temperance
Friendly Society, he’ll hardly like a wife who washes her
head in beer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nonsense! How can you know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fact. It’s to make her hair wavy. There’s nothing her
brother Barnaby don’t let out to my poor old dad. She was at
it the day you all came to the Farm. It wasn’t that she had her
bodice off and her hair down after the douche,”—Bundock
seemed to savour these details—“she didn’t want him to
smell it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>you</span> seem to smell out everything,” she said severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do have a nose like Nip’s!” he chuckled. But although
Mr. Flippance’s letter was under it, he was forced to go off
without even discovering that it did contain a financial document.
Very amazed indeed was Jinny to see it drop out, this IOU,
which was for herself and not Mrs. Purley, and represented half
a crown! Retiring to her kitchen, she studied the large-scrawled
pages.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Jinny</span>,—I have just read in Madame F.’s copy of
her <span class='it'>London Journal</span> (which like Mrs. Micawber she will never
desert, at least not till the present serial is finished) an extract
from the <span class='it'>Chelmsford Chronicle</span> about the miraculous saving of
a cornstack belonging to our mutual friend, Mr. Caleb Flynt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gather that a flood must have devastated Little Bradmarsh,
and I write at once to know if all my friends are safe,
especially your charming little self. Strange to think that
the parlour in which I breakfasted on bacon and mushrooms
in your sweet society may have been washed away! But
such is life—a shadow-pantomime!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are still at Boulogne, you see. For one thing—to speak
frankly—it’s a providential place to be at when funds are for
the moment low, and it appears that Madame F.’s fortune—all
that the villain Duke left of it—is in Spanish bonds. I need
say no more. (I think I told you she was the niece of the
famous Cairo Contortionist, and doubtless it was during the
star’s sensationally successful season at Madrid that she was
thus misled.) The wily master of marionettes must have been
aware of this when he got [“her off his hands” appeared
quite legibly here, though scratched out with heavy strokes]
back his show over her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our present plans are, before attempting London (which
though almost barren of talent calls for overmuch of the ready),
to launch an English season in Boulogne itself, where there is
such a large English circle, that saves so much by being here
immune from sheriff’s officers that it can well afford the
luxury of the theatre, not to mention the many French people
here who must be anxious to learn English, especially after
their visit to the Great Exhibition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Between you and I, I fear that Madame F.’s hopes will be
dashed by the fact that the French have no eyes or ears except
for a Jewess called Rachel, but as they have nothing near as
good in the male line, we may yet—between us—show them
something!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this fails—and I have seen too much of the public to be
surprised at any ingratitude—there are always those wonderful
new goldfields, where men of our race and speech are flocking,
pickaxe on shoulder. Surely after their arduous toil for the
filthy lucre, they must be longing of an evening for a glimpse
of the higher life—I understand they have only drinking
shanties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Imagine it, Jinny—a theatre for the rugged miners amid
the primeval mountains with a practicable moon shining over
the tropical scene. Pity I sold Duke that theatre-tent, but I
suppose it couldn’t be transported to Australia as easily as a
convict. (Good gag, that, eh?) Admission, I suppose, by
nugget. I don’t see how you can give change—unless they
take it in gold-dust—and anyhow, flush as they are, they will
probably hand in considerable chunks at the box-office,
reckless of petty calculation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do not be surprised if one Easter morn you receive a
golden egg laid by some Australian goose (I understand it is
half a mole). Which reminds me to enclose herewith the half-crown
I owe you. I dare say you have forgotten my borrowing
it from you in the caravan of my blood-sucking son-in-law.
But players have long memories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you see nothing of him or of Polly, for Chipstone
is a poor pitch, but I am afraid from a Christmas card Polly
sent me in reply to mine that the rascal is making her happy,
so I can’t hate him as much as he deserves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I hope,’ I scribbled across the picture of the snowy
Mistletoe Bough I sent her, ‘you are experiencing all that
matrimony was designed for, when this institution was introduced
into Eden.’ Lovely, isn’t it? And where do you
suppose it came from? It was that delicious Martha’s farewell
wish to me on my wedding morning! I fancy she took
it out of the number of the <span class='it'>Lightstand</span> that I bought her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor, dear Martha! Do give her my love and tell her
there is a branch of the New Jerusalemites in Boulogne—no,
best make it two, while you are about it, a French branch as
well as an English branch, mutually emulous in ‘Upbuilding!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how is her dashing cavalier of a son who posed as an
American? I expect he’s married by now to the queen of the
wasp-killers, judging by the warm way things were going at
my own wedding-party. If so, pray hand him back his
mother’s Christadelphian wedding-wish with my kind regards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, and don’t forget to say amiable things (as they put it
here) to Miss What’s-a-name, the young and lovely bridesmaid!
Tell her I haven’t forgotten about her becoming
wardrobe mistress, though if we go to Australia, I’m afraid
it’ll be too rough for her at her age, and even Madame F. may
shrink from the snakes and the blacks and the convicts and
the desperado diggers, in which case we shall have boys to do
the female parts and revive the glories of the Shakespearean
stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens, how I have let myself chatter on! My paper is
nearly at an end—like youth and hope! Believe me, dear
Jinny, in this world or the next (don’t be alarmed, I only mean
Australia),</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.25em;'>“Your ever devoted,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.25em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Tony Flippance</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P.S.—I am so sorry but I find I can’t find (excuse my
Irish) <span class='it'>any</span> way of sending the half-crown by post, so I am
compelled to send you an IOU, but if you send it to Polly
(Duke’s Marionettes, England, is sure to find her some day)
I have no doubt she will honour it on my behalf. Safest
address for me by the way is Poste Restante, Boulogne, as
Madame F. likes trying different hotels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P.P.S.—There is a game here called ‘Little Horses.’ Most
fascinating.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Many and mixed were Jinny’s feelings as she ploughed through
this bulky document, swollen by the opulent handwriting.
Having no notion about investments, she vaguely imagined that
Spanish robbers had impounded Cleopatra’s money, and it
added to her sense of the unsettled state of the Continent. As
for the IOU, she was angrily amused to think that he had
already paid her the half-crown on the very morning of the
bacon and mushrooms so fondly recalled, and that she had
bought him his wedding present—a Bible—with it. To pay
little debts twice over while defrauding the big creditors (and
she had reason to think Miss Gentry as well as the Purleys had
been left unpaid) seemed to her only an aggravation of fecklessness.
But perhaps the Flippances had not meant to be dishonest:
it was those Spanish freebooters that were to blame, who
had captured the gold destined for Little Bradmarsh. The
humiliation of his reference to Blanche was hard to bear—it
made her want to dismiss Will altogether—but oddly enough a
still keener emotion was kindled by Mr. Flippance’s obsession
with Australia. Yes, Australia was in the air, it was a net into
which everybody was being swept. Will was going from her—and
to a place bristling with blacks and snakes and convicts
and desperado diggers. Never had she received so perturbing
a letter.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the menacing silence of Will, she began to study this interloping
and kidnapping Australia. For it was not only his
silence that menaced: through the hundred threads of her
carrying career—antennæ always groping for news of him—she
learned that his resolve was fixed. Indeed, Frog Farm was
almost the only place on her rounds where his departure was
not talked of. At the fountain head she could collect no information,
for Martha was the only person she now saw there and
the old lady seemed anxious, after receiving her parcels, to rush
back to the clearing up of the colossal mess of the receded flood:
a work in which the scrupulously invisible Will was understood
to be lending a hand almost as vigorous as his father’s, albeit a
single hand. But if the other was still in its sling, it was getting
dangerously better, she gathered from Bundock’s father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That he would go without another word to her was highly
probable. Was there not in Finchingfield a hot-tempered
farmer who had kept silence for seven years after his wife’s
death? Miss Gentry, who in her Colchester days used to make
his wife’s gowns—the lady riding in behind him to be measured—said
it was from remorse because he had once used an improper
expression to her. And this same Essex obstinacy was liable to
manifest itself in less noble forms, as her grandfather’s feuds had
proved abundantly. Will would shake off the soil of old England
as surlily as he had shaken it off in his boyhood. As he had run
away from his parents, so he would now run away from her,
though far more unreasonably. But this time she would at
least know where he was going, and her tortured soul reached
out hungrily to picture his new world. The Spelling-Book was
absolutely blank about Australia—how empty and worthless
loomed that storehouse of information, with this gigantic lacuna!—but
from a bound magazine volume of Miss Gentry’s, borrowed
for the first time, she drew confirmation of her worst fears. It
was a place that needed many more stations and out-stations of
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and there were
mosquitoes that could only be kept off by lighted torches, and
biting spiders as big as your palm; after frying at 105 in the
shade, you might shiver the next moment in the icy blast of the
“Southern Buster.” And there were dust-winds to boot. If
you went to the cemetery of Port Phillip, you would see that the
majority of deaths were between the ages of thirty and forty.
This premature mortality was due to the excessive drinking of
cold water natural in so droughty a country. What a blessing
that Will was not, like Mr. Skindle, a member of the Temperance
Friendly Society! Nor was the labour market, congested as it
was with ticket-of-leave men and bounty-emigrants from England,
really superior to that of the old country, while house-rents were
twice as high. As for the interior, another number of the
magazine contained a story in which “an ill-favoured man with
his arm in a sling” was pursued by a bull amid mimosa swamps
in a setting of blacks with tomahawks and whites with pistols.
“The Bull and the Bush,” she murmured whimsically to herself,
but at heart she was cold with apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then by a strange coincidence she found reassurance. Calling
on Mrs. Bidlake in her confinement, she found the mother well
and the new child vigorous. But it was not from their condition
merely that emanated the novel atmosphere of happiness that
radiated over the household: perhaps, indeed, the well-being
was only a consequence of the happiness. For the Bidlakes, too,
were off to Australia, though not to the goldfields. The cloud
over the family had lifted at last. Not that Hezekiah had been
proved innocent, but that he was become opulent. Released on
ticket-of-leave, the sturdy ploughman had got a position with a
cottage and garden in that “splendid suny clim” as he now
called it, and then, just as he was about to send for Sophy and
Sally, he had won six hundred and forty acres on the outskirts
of Port Phillip in a lottery run by the Bank of Australasia! If
he could borrow the capital from the bank, as was not improbable,
he would be able to cut up his prize into ten-acre allotments and
build houses on it—by that you simply doubled or trebled your
outlay in a few years. His sister should have a house anyhow,
and in the meantime her husband could help him manage
or farm the vast estate. As for the “dere gels” there would be
no need for them to work now, though if they wanted pocket-money
they would be snapped up for service, and get as much
as sixteen pounds a year each. He had already sent fifty pounds
towards the passage-money, and would raise more when he
knew if they would all come out, and moreover he understood
that there was a Family Colonization Society in London to
which Ephraim might apply for an advance. What a change,
this going out of theirs, from that dreadful departure in the
prison coach for the hulks and Botany Bay! Jinny, sharing
their tears of joy, was vastly relieved on her own account at the
paradise the grotesquely spelt letter conjured up, and she
rejoiced to reflect that all that ancient barbarous harshness of
magistrates and judges had led under Providence to the enrichment
of Britain’s new soil with the sweat of her skilled agriculturists,
and was even opening up new horizons for their innocent
relatives. For assuredly this <span class='it'>was</span> a paradise on earth, if Hezekiah’s
letter was not a shameless lure for his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Think of tea at eighteenpence a pound—even a shilling if bought
by the chest!—think of sugar at twopence-halfpenny, and neck
of mutton at a penny a pound, nay, a whole sheep for five
shillings. Think of pork at twopence and the best cows’ butter
at sixpence; and after one has been reduced to turnips and dry
bread, think of a land where ox-tails can be had for the skinning
and sheeps’ heads and plucks by the barrow for the fetching
away. A land where, as he wound up rapturously, any man
who worked could have his bellyful, and where everything
was plentiful except women, so that his girls would be
able to pick and choose among the “gumsuckers” and have
“cornstalks” for husbands. They shouldn’t marry among the
“prisoners,” please God, for he didn’t reckon himself in that set,
having done nothing to be ashamed of, though he did see now
that threshing-machines were necessary when you had a lot
of land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they want women so badly, I might do worse than go
myself,” said Jinny laughingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, whatever would Little Bradmarsh do without you?”
said Ephraim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did without me well enough,” she said bitterly. Indeed
her first fine faith in human nature could not be mended as
easily as the broken bridge, nor did the depreciatory allusions of
her old customers to the deceased coach, and their compliments
at her return, soften her cynicism. And as she spoke, she felt a
sudden yearning to be done with them all: the infection of the
new world began to steal into her veins too, but she knew her
own exodus was impossible while her grandfather lived, and
though she played with the idea and asked if she might copy
Hezekiah’s instructions for the passage, her real design was to
gather information for Will’s sake. It was very worrying
though to copy the recommendations in the original spelling.
“Of kors i don’t now wot the shipps is like nowerdies, but the
nu chums ses they dont give no solt, onni roc-solt (solt is peny
a pound here, peper 2d. nounc) and you’ll want thik warm
close and moor beding.” There was an elaborate list of provisions
necessary to supplement the ship’s dietary during the
four weary months—it hardly needed copying, since it embraced
a little of everything edible that would keep—but she was glad
again that Will was not a temperance man when she found a
bottle of brandy recommended as an indispensable medicine for
the contingencies of the voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neglecting even the last instalment of her debt to Miss Gentry—had
not the dressmaker given her the alternative of working
it out?—Jinny began to acquire the longest-lived comestibles,
storing them secretly in one of the ante-room chests. And it
was by this concentration on Will’s interests that she managed
to live through his dreadful silence, nay, to enjoy long spells of
day-dreaming in which these edibles were for their joint Australian
larder. The goldfields her imagination dismissed as
bristling with “desperado diggers.” It was on the more idyllic
images of her magazine article, written before the days of the
discovery of gold, that her imagination fed. For though the
writer denigrated the urban labour market, he admitted that
there was plenty of room for rural labour, and then—with what
seemed so uncanny a prying into her affairs that it flushed her
cheek and made her heart beat faster—he postulated a young
couple without capital setting up housekeeping together, and
instructed them to take employment with a farmer while saving
up enough to buy a small farm or herd of their own. The
system, it appeared, was that the employer supplied rations as
well as money-wages, and that while the husband worked on
the land, the wife could do the farm cooking. (How lucky she
had had so much experience, Jinny thought.) Nay, these rations,
said the article (pursuing her affairs to what the blushing reader
thought the point of indelicacy) would practically suffice for the
children too, and when they grew up—-but her delicious daydream
rarely went so far as this calculation of them as independent
labour-assets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happy couple would also be permitted to keep a few cows,
pigs, and fowls. Here the thought of Methusalem would intrude
distressfully, and the difficulty of transporting him to the
Antipodes. But when he had been left at Frog Farm in the
loving hands of Caleb and Martha (become almost his parents-in-law),
under promise of leisurely grazing for the rest of his life,
with perhaps a rare jaunt to Chipstone market for their household
needs, this ideal solution only reminded her of the phantasmal
nature of the whole scheme, for Frog Farm could certainly not
be saddled with her grandfather. But lest she should remember
too cruelly its visionary character, the day-dream would at this
point dart off swiftly on the journey through the Bush in quest
of an idyllic spot free from blacks and provided with a generous
employer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunate that this journey was to be so inexpensive, there being
no inns (not even “The Bull and Bush”), but every settler being
compelled by a wise decree of this wonderful State to give the
<span class='it'>bona fide</span> traveller board and lodging for nothing. What a
lovely journey that would be—if only one dodged the blacks and
the diggers and the swamps with the alligators. She saw herself
and Will bounding along like kangaroos (with Nip of course in
attendance, she did not intend to take up with a dingo instead)
through mimosa-bushes (like the scrub on the Common, only
gaudier), and eating their dinner-packets under giant gum-trees,
so enchantingly blue, whose tops, five hundred feet high, one
might climb so as to survey the route for signs of native camps
or friendly farmers. If there was no settler in sight by the time
darkness fell, they would just perch themselves like birds in a
nest of high branches out of all danger, and go to sleep under
the starry heaven, which she saw vividly with the old constellations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Closer to the real was her picture of the tenement with which
the ideal farmer (when found) would provide his young couple.
There would just be a few poles driven into the ground to support
the roof of gum-bark, with its hole to let out the smoke. But
of course one need not live much indoors in that climate—despite
the occasional vagaries of the “Southerly Buster”—and
it would be all the easier not to have to spend money on furniture.
Why, put in Nip’s basket, lay out Will’s razor and slippers,
set out her Spelling-Book and the Peculiar Hymn-Book the
young rebel had thrown into the bushes, hang up his hat and
her bonnet, and the place already begins to look like home. As
for Will’s box—presumably conveyed to the chosen spot by the
local carrier in a bullock-cart—it is so large it will crowd out
everything else and furnish the place of itself. Decked with a
rug it will serve as sofa, covered with a cloth it becomes a table.
Lucky she has not brought a box of her own, but has squeezed
her things into his—in that wonderful, incredible fusion of two
existences!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hard to wake from these day-dreams to the wretched
reality, and yet Uncle Lilliwhyte profited from one of these
awakenings, for her Australian hut had reminded her of his
English specimen, and she hurried to see it and him. She found
them both in a bad way. His wading overmuch in the flood in
quest of salvage had brought back more than a touch of his
rheumatism, while the winds and rain had left his shanty leakier
than ever. They were both breaking up, the ancient and his
shell, and she now did her best to patch both up. Already in
her new affluence she had called in young Ravens to mend her
grandfather’s bedroom ceiling and redaub the gaps in the walls,
and it was simple to turn this Jack-of-all-trades and fountain of
melody on to the derelict hut in the woods. The poor old “Uncle”
had hitherto built his fire as well as he could on the ground on
the leeward side of his hut; Jinny now installed an old stove
which she bought up cheap at the pawnbroker’s and conveyed
to the verge of the wood. But the hole in the roof that might
serve for Australia would not do for England, and after Ravens
had re-thickened the walls with fresh faggots and re-thatched
the hut with shavings presented by Barnaby, Jinny was amused
to find that what seemed an iron chimney turned out on closer
inspection to consist of three old top-hats. Where the ancient
had picked up these treasures—whether in the flood or in his
normal scavenging—he refused to say. “Happen Oi’ve got a
mort o’ culch ye don’t know of,” he cackled, enjoying her admiration
of his architecture. She wanted to have a floor to the hut,
but this, like the exchange of his sacking for a pallet-bed, he
opposed strenuously. “Gimme the smell o’ the earth,” he said.
“Ye’ve shut out the stars and that’s enough.” He accepted,
however, a bolster for a pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By such interests and devices, aided by her regular rounds,
Jinny staved off too clear a consciousness of the inevitable
parting, which would not even have the grace of a parting. But
the inexorable moment was like a black monster bearing down
upon her—and yet it was not really advancing, it was rather
something retreating: it could not even be visualized as a shock
against which one could brace one’s shoulders. There was the
horror of the impalpable in this silent drift away from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when at last the day of departure was named, and came
vibrating to her across a dozen subtle threads, the negative
torture turned to a positive that was still more racking. It was
on the Friday—unlucky day!—that Will was to leave for London,
and here was already Tuesday. Some of her threads conveyed
even the rumour that, in order to save a little cash for his start
at the Antipodes, he meant to work his passage. And here was
she unable to pack his box or even to slip her provisions into it;
doomed by all the laws of sex and proper spirit to watch—bound
hand and foot as in a nightmare—the receding of the mate
whose lips had sealed her his. By the Wednesday morning even
her grandfather observed something was wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye ain’t eatin’ no breakfus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Gran’fer, lots!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do ye don’t tell me no fibs. Oi’ve noticed your appetite
fallin’ lower and lower like the flood, and now there’s a’mos’
nawthen o’ neither. And ye used to be my little mavis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t want me to eat snails or worms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis your singin’, Oi mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>There is Hey!</span>” she chanted obediently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’re the most aggravatin’ gal—minds me o’ your great-gran’mother.
Ye need your mouth for eatin’, not singin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a sleepless night, unable to bear this inactivity, she ran
round to the Bidlake lodgings to suggest that as young Mr. Flynt
seemed to be sailing for Australia, it might be a neighbourly action
to show him Hezekiah’s hints to travellers. But she gathered
from the happy mother that the absent Ephraim had already
talked to Will about the heavier clothes and the bedding, and
that Will had said how fortunate it was he had sold off his
summer suits, so as in any case to get the latest make at Moses
&amp; Son’s on his passage through London. Jinny suspected he
had sold them off to raise funds for the voyage. Still the bravado
of this pretence of a London outfit did not displease her. She
learnt too that there had been a question of Will’s convoying
the ex-convict’s daughters to their impatient parent, as the
Ephraim Bidlakes would not be ready for ages, but it had been
thought scarcely proper in view of their age and looks—a decision
Jinny thought wise. Indeed, the idea that he was <span class='it'>not</span> to be thus
companioned almost reconciled her, by contrast, to his departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she got home she found to her surprise that her grandfather
was entertaining Martha Flynt, who was far from the
spruceness she usually achieved for outsiders of the other sex.
She looked draggled and worn after her long and windy walk.
What astonished Jinny most was that the old rheumatic woman
should have trudged so far, and she opined that her business
must be pressing and must be with herself. For it could hardly
lie in the Christadelphian texts with which Martha seemed to
be battering and bemusing the nonagenarian, whose great Bible
lay open between them, and who was disconcerted to find her
texts really there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha had never set foot in Blackwater Hall before, so far
as Jinny could remember, and very strange it was to see her
sitting over her cup of tea which she must have made for herself
at her host’s invitation. With all his perturbation over the
texts, he seemed only too brisked up by this amazing visit from
a female, the first unwhiskered being, save Jinny, he had met for
many moons. It was a fillip he did not need, Jinny considered:
the old good food again, the sweet security, the satisfaction of
revenge, had made his eyes less bleared, filled out his flacked
cheeks and given him a new lease of strength and sanity—a sort
of second wind—and this visit might only over-stimulate him.
She did not like the undercurrent of excitement that showed
itself in the twitching of his limbs and eyelids, especially when
Martha declared he could not be really accepting the Book as
all-inspired if he believed man’s heaven lay in the skies.
“Whither I go, ye cannot come,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that,” said Daniel Quarles fiercely, and
clenched his fists as if he meant to storm the gates of cloudland.
“And ain’t ye forgittin’ ’Lijah what went up to heaven with a
chariot and bosses o’ fire? That won’t happen to ’Lijah Skindle,
damn him—he’ll have the chariot o’ fire, but he won’t git no
higher. He, he, he!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martha was momentarily baffled by Elijah’s ascension, but
recovering her nerve, she dealt John iii. 13, “No man hath
ascended up to heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partly to soothe the old man, partly to give Martha a chance
of speaking out, Jinny here intervened with the suggestion that
he himself should ascend up to his room and bring down the
telescope to amuse his guest withal. Obviously relieved—for he
felt himself in a tight textual corner—he hastened upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that the old woman, bursting into tears, and
clutching at Jinny’s arm, sobbed out: “Oh, Jinny, you’ve got
to come back with me—you’ve got to come back at once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny turned cold and sick. What had happened to Will?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what for?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Willie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her worst fears were confirmed. “Is he hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish he was a little,” Martha sobbed. “But even his
arm’s all right now.” What Martha went on to say Jinny never
remembered, for she was suddenly sobbing with Martha. But
hers was the hysteria of relief, and when she at last understood
that what Martha was asking was that she should come back
and marry Will, so that he should stay near his mother, her
heart hardened again. It was not that she made any attempt
to deny her love—things seemed suddenly to have got beyond
that—but Martha, she felt, knew not what she asked, seeming
to have divined from her boy’s demeanour a lover’s quarrel, but
without any inkling of the real tangle and deadlock. Even if
she humiliated herself, as Martha half unwittingly suggested, it
was all a blind-alley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My making it up won’t keep him in England,” she urged.
“He’s got no money. And no more have I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She might have been more willing to make a last desperate
dash of her head against the brick wall, had she understood how
Martha had fought against her from the first and how pitiable
was her surrender now, but no suspicion of that underground
opposition had ever crossed her mind, nor did Martha now
confess what indeed she no longer remembered clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s room for you in Frog Farm, dearie. We’d love
to have you. We’ve always loved you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” Jinny moaned. “It’s all no use. And I’ve got
Gran’fer!” Indeed, Martha’s passionate plea had curiously
clarified and steadied her mind, reconciling her to the inevitable.
To go to Will was exactly what she had been yearning to do.
But when the plea for such action came through Martha’s mouth,
she could see it from outside, as it were, realize its futility and
cleanse her bosom of it. She felt strangely braced by her own
refusal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve got some provisions for the voyage,” she said, “that
you might smuggle into his box—I know it’s big enough. And
I do hope, Mrs. Flynt, he’s not going to work his passage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wish he was, for he mightn’t find a ship. But you see
Flynt <span class='it'>would</span> go and advance him the money and insist he must
go steerage like a gentleman. He’s got no heart, hasn’t Flynt,”
she wept, “he only wants to settle down in peace after Will and
the flood, and sit under his vine and fig-tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t cry—here’s Gran’fer coming down. I tell you what I
<span class='it'>will</span> do, Mrs. Flynt, I will call for his box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, bless you, Jinny!” Martha fell on her neck. “If you
come, he won’t go! That’s as sure as sunrise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then I can bring him his provisions,” Jinny pointed out
sceptically, as she disentangled herself from Martha’s arms.
Then both females were dumbed by the sight of the Gaffer
returning in his best smock and with his beard combed! He
tendered Martha the telescope with a debonair gesture. But
Martha, her mission comparatively successful, departed so
precipitately that the poor old man felt his toilette wasted, not
to mention his telescope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a flighty young woman,” was his verdict, “as full o’
warses as our thatch o’ warmin. Sets herself up agin John.
Wesley as searched the Scriptures afore she was born.” And
laying down his telescope, he turned over the pages of his Bible,
and perpending her textual irritants and questing for antidotes,
fell quietly asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was delighted when she returned the next afternoon, and
he played Genesis v. 24, with a snort of triumph, by way of
greeting. Martha tremulously countered with Acts ii. 34, and
denied that Enoch had gone up to heaven, but it was obvious
her heart was not in the game, and Jinny was glad when Ravens’
ladder was clapped against the casement and his padded knees
appeared in an ascension of a purely terrestrial character, however
celestial the melody that accompanied it. For the Gaffer had
grown fond of this bird-of-all-work, now in the rôle of thatcher,
and would hasten to hover about him, fussily directing the
operations of his club, shears, or needle, correcting the words
and airs of his songs, and even joining him in duets. Ravens’
encouragement of the older bird had become almost as alarming
to Jinny as his shameless delay in sending in his bill and his
positive refusal to charge for Uncle Lilliwhyte’s repairs, but this
afternoon his advent was welcome, though the noise and jingle
of the duets outside made her conversation with Martha difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He mustn’t go—he mustn’t go,” Mrs. Flynt sobbed. “It’s
like the New Jerusalem coming down and going up again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny quite appreciated that. “I thought he wouldn’t let
me call for his box,” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, the pig-headed mule! He’s going to carry it himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what? It’s not easy to get anything but me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows that. That’s why he’s carrying it. On his
shoulders, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With his arm just healed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There won’t be much inside—he’s going to buy his things in
London!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the box itself—why, it’s big enough to pack himself in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, I know, dearie. But Caleb says he carried it himself
all the way from Chipstone. And chock-full, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny suppressed a faint smile. “I remember,” she said.
“But perhaps he’ll break down before he gets it to Chipstone,”
she added encouragingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do you think so, dearie?” Then Martha’s face fell.
“But he only means to carry it to ‘The King of Prussia.’ There’s
a commercial traveller going from there in a trap to catch the
same coach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let us hope he’ll never get to ‘The King of Prussia.’ ”
Martha shook her head. “You see, Flynt’s offered to bear
a hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well!” said Jinny. “Then it’s all settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he won’t have his father, either. Nearly bullied his
head off. So Flynt’s going to keep behind him all the way in
case of a breakdown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picture of Caleb slinking furtively along the roads, behind
his boy and the box, moved Jinny’s risible muscles, and she
burst into a laugh that was not far from tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, Jinny! I can’t bear it. You can’t love him, or you
wouldn’t sit there and laugh. I always knew you weren’t the
right girl for him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny took this as the babbling of a mind distraught. “You’ll
get over it,” she assured the old woman, patting the thin hand
with the worn wedding-ring. “And he’s bound to come back.”
The necessity of quieting Martha was fortifying: Jinny was like
a queasy passenger saved from sea-sickness by having to look
after a still worse sailor. She was the soul of the company at
tea, staving off the duel of texts and sending Ravens into
ecstasies over her quips and flashes. There was one bad moment,
however, when Daniel Quarles candidly remarked to Mrs. Flynt:
“Ravens should be tellin’ me as your Willie’s gooin’ furrin.
Ye’ll be well riddy o’ the rascal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Willie’s an angel!” cried Martha hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could there be angels ef there ain’t no heaven?” he
queried, with a crafty cackle. “Noa, noa, Mrs. Flynt, it ain’t no
use kiverin’ up as he’s a bad egg. But one bad in a dozen or sow
is fair allowance. Ye’re luckier than me, what hadn’t even one
good ’un. Now ef Ravens here had been <span class='it'>my</span> buo-oy——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny saw Martha a bit of the way home. She had now found
a new compromise. “Tell Will that Ravens will come with
my cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what will be the good of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will save him the strain of carrying the box. And then
as to-morrow’s my day, I shall have to meet my cart at ‘The
King of Prussia.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny, then you will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—but don’t tell him. Only say Ravens will call for the
box at eight o’clock—that will give him time to walk if he jibs
at the cart for himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had all been arranged with the obliging bird-of-all-work, and
Ravens had left Blackwater Hall that evening, carolling even
more blithely than usual, when Jinny found—evidently pushed
under the house-door—a mysterious cocked-hat addressed “Miss
Boldero.” With trembling fingers she opened it, her heart
thumping. “To hell with Ravens! You can keep him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This utterly unexpected flash of an utterly unforeseen
jealousy, and the thought that he had been drawn so spatially
near again, was all that stood between her and despair that
last dreadful night.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When the fateful Friday dawned, it found Jinny fast asleep,
worn out after long listening to a wind that would soon be
tossing a ship about. In those harsh hours she had felt it would
be impossible to get up and go on her round in the morning.
But no sooner were her eyes unsealed, than there sprang up in
her mind the thought that, did she fail her customers to-day,
gossip would at once connect her breakdown with Will’s departure.
So far, she had reason to believe, Martha’s guess at their
relations had not penetrated outside. But eyes were sharp and
tongues sharper, and she must not be exposed to pity. Under
this goad she sprang up instanter and did her hair carefully
before the cracked mirror and dressed herself in her best and
smartest. She would go around with gibe and laughter and
fantasias on the horn, and whatever was consonant with
celebrating the final retreat of the coach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning was quiet after the blustrous night, but the year,
like her fate, was at its dreariest moment—no colour in sky or
garden, no hint of the Spring—and at breakfast a reaction overcame
her. But this time her grandfather did not observe her
depression: he was too full of the crime of ’Lijah, who—according
to Martha—was putting his mother in the Chipstone
poorhouse prior to installing his bride in Rosemary Villa. So
garrulous was he this morning that Jinny—her mind morbidly
possessed by a story of a miner who was found dead of starvation
in the Bush with a bag of gold for his pillow—ceased to listen
to his diatribes, retaining only an uneasy sense that he was
twitching and jerking with the same excitement as when Martha
had first come. “And Oi count ye’ll be doin’ the same with me
one day,” she heard him say at last, for he was shaking her arm.
“But Oi’d have ye know it’s my business, not yourn—Daniel
Quarles, Carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny wearily assured him that there was no danger of her
ever marrying, and she felt vexed with Martha for coming and
starting such agitated trains of thought in his aged brain.
Possibly the foolish mother might even have broached to him
her desire to rob him of his granddaughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye ought to be glad Oi’ve give ye food and shelter and them
fine clothes ye’ve titivated yourself with,” he went on, unsoothed,
“bein’ as there ain’t enough in the business for myself. ’Tis a
daily sacrifice, Jinny, and do ye don’t forgit it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prompt arrival of Ravens made a break, but she had to
cancel with thanks her request for his services with the cart, and
then, when the old man was settled at his Bible, and her bonnet
and shawl were on, she collapsed in the ante-room, sinking down
on the chest in which she had hoarded Will’s provisions, and
feeling her resolution oozing away with every tick of the Dutch
clock. Impossible to whip up a pseudo-gaiety, to make the tour
of all these inquisitive faces! And through the lassitude of her
whole being pierced every now and then her grandfather’s voice,
crying “Tush, you foolish woman!” She knew it was not
meant for her, but for an imagined Martha whose texts he was
confuting, but it sounded dismally apposite, and when once he
declared “Wiser folks than you knowed it all afore you was
born,” she bowed her head as before the human destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the clock struck nine, he came stalking in. “Why,
Jinny! Ain’t to-day Friday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised a miserable face. “Yes, but I’m going to-morrow
instead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow be dangnationed!” he cried, upset. “Oi’ve,
never missed my Friday yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t feel like going to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll never do, Jinny. Ye’ll ruin my business with your
whimwhams and mulligrubs. And it don’t yarn enough as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no competition—it doesn’t matter now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is that your thanks to the Lord for drowndin’ Pharaoh
and his chariot and hosses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she put her head back in her hands. “Do let me be!”
she snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ye feel well, Jinny?” he said, with a change of tone.
“Have ye got shoots o’ pain in your brain-box?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right, but I don’t want to go to-day. I should only
make muddles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t make muddles,” he said fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me be. I can’t harness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then Oi’ll do it, dearie. You just set there—Oi’ll put the
door a bit ajar and once you’re in the fresh air you’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard him shuffle back into the living-room and thence
into the kitchen as the shortest way to the stable, and then,
almost immediately, she became aware of a little noise at the
garden-gate. She was sitting opposite the clock, and through
the slit at the doorway she beheld, to her amaze, a red-headed
figure outside the gate, sitting on a box and mopping its brow
as it gazed sentimentally at the cottage. Even in the wild
leaping of her pulses, the grotesqueness of their both sitting
gloomily on boxes—so near and yet so far—tickled her sense of
humour. But as she sat on, smiling and fluttering, she saw
him rise, cast a cautious look round, open the gate, and steal
towards the living-room. In a bound she was within and waiting
by the closed casement, and as his expected peep came, the
lattice flew back in his face and her hysteric mockery rang out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you’d never look on my face again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was almost a greater surprise than when she had appeared
with Methusalem walking the waters, for he had counted her
just as surely set out on her Friday round as the sun itself, and
his sentimental journey safe from misunderstanding (or was it
understanding?).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t cackle!” he snarled. “I might have guessed
you’d try to catch me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gulped down the sobs that were trying to strangle her
speech. How glad she was that she had on her best frock! “I
overslept myself!” she said gaily. “Gran’fer’s harnessing. I
see you’ve brought your box! You’re just in time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t brought my box!” he snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do ye don’t tell me no fibs,” she parodied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, it’s going from ‘The King of Prussia.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really? Well I’ll take it over the bridge for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you! I’m taking it there myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This don’t seem the shortest cut to Long Bradmarsh,” she
observed blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glowered. “Shows how easily I can carry it. I’m having
a good-bye look at all the old places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But below this surface conversation they were holding one of
their old silent duologues. Jinny’s heart was beating fast with
happiness and triumph as her eyes told him he would never get
away now, and he, hypnotized by that dancing light in them,
dumbly acknowledged he was self-trapped. Yet how they were
going to get out of their impasse, and how his pride was to be
reconciled with their reconciliation, neither had the ghost of an
idea. “I see,” she replied, as if accepting his explanation of
his visit. “But as to <span class='it'>this</span> old place, I’m afraid Ravens has
rather changed the look of it with his new thatch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He snorted at the name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ll find it unchanged inside,” she added affably, “if
you come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t begin that again! You know I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me! I had forgotten that old nonsense. Well, you
can come nearer and peep in.” Her face shone at the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face worked wildly with the struggle not to approach hers.
“I did have a peep. Good-bye, I’ve got the coach to catch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the cart will be ready in a moment. Gran’fer is so
slow harnessing. Hark! Nip’s getting impatient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his hat. “Thank you, but I told you I was my own
carrier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, then. Pity you came so out of your way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned, and his feet dragged themselves hopelessly gateward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She waved her hand desperately through the casement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck, Will! Hope you’ll strike plenty of nuggets!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Jinny!” He opened the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll let me know how you’re getting on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you like!” The gate clicked behind him. Her mother-wit
leapt to stave off the moment beyond which all her frenzied
questing for some solution would be waste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear me, Will! Where is my memory going? Put your
box in the porch a moment, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got a few little things for the voyage—I really forgot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny!” He came back through the gate. “But I
don’t need to bring the box to the door. I’ll take the things
from you through the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want to pack them in properly—I can’t on the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nobody passing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never can tell. We don’t want Bundock——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ll pack them in myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d never trust a man—in fact I expect I’ll have to repack
all the rest. Look at Mr. Flippance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still he hung back. “There’s lots of room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. Like a sensible man you’re getting your outfit in
London. Bring it along. Or shall I lend you a hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No!” He hurriedly shouldered the huge box and
Jinny heard its contents shifting like a withered kernel in a
nutshell. It was the same American trunk with the overarching
lid, and as he swaggered up the garden with it, it seemed to
her as if time had rolled back to last Spring. But what comedies
and tragedies had intervened between the two box-carryings,
all sprung from the same obstinacy! And yet, she felt, she
did not love him the less for his manly assertiveness: how
sweet would be the surrender when their sparring was over
and her will could be legitimately embraced in his, held like
herself in those masterful, muscular arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mind was really in her Australian hut as he dumped the box
at her feet. No, it would hardly do for a table, she thought, with
that lid-curvature. Then she braced herself for a tricky tussle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, where’s the goods?” he said lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be so unbelieving—they’re in that spruce-hutch. Four
months, you know, you’ve got to provide against.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” he said glumly, unlocking his trunk and throwing
up the lid violently. He would have liked to smash the springs.
But the lid, lined with cheap striped cloth, stood up stiffly,
refusing to give him a pretext for postponing his journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny from her doorway gazed at the jumble in the great void.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shove it forward a bit,” she said carelessly, moving backwards
within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your end of the box is not under cover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might rain and spoil your things—I’m sure I saw a drop.”
She tugged at the handle and the trunk slid along the porch and
some inches over the sill. Unostentatiously he pulled it back a
bit, but she jerked it in again. “Do leave it where I can see
the things,” she said with simulated fretfulness. “Good
gracious!” She drew out the frock-coat he had sported for the
Flippance wedding. “What’s this grandeur for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, for funerals and things like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Bush? And fancy packing it next to the blanket.
It’s all over hairs. I’ll brush it and sell it for you—Ravens will
be wanting one for the wedding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What wedding?” he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Skindle’s, of course. Weren’t you invited?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced, and unrebuked she threw his wedding raiment
over the provision-chest. “We’d best keep this on top,” she
said, drawing out the blanket, “else you won’t get at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect you’ll be married by the time I’m back,” he
remarked with aloofness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. I’ll never marry now. I’ve seen too much of men’s
foolishness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to be an old maid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I live long enough!” Her vaunt of youth was dazzling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hope you won’t!” he said fervently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t live? Oh, Will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t fade into that. You know what I mean. The
sweetest rose must fade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So will this muffler—fortunately. Haven’t you taken your
dad’s ‘muckinger’ by mistake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—you leave that be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a let of Sunday collars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weekdays too I like a clean collar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ow, this onrighteous generation,” she said in Caleb’s voice, “all
one to them, Sundays or no Sundays.” She pulled up his cloak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You leave that cloak be!” he said, laughing despite himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now your sling’s off, you don’t need it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do. Let it be, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she unrolled it mischievously and a packet of letters fell
out—<span class='it'>her</span> letters about the great horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, didn’t I say men were silly!” she cried. “Fancy
taking that to Australia.” And she made as if to hurl them
towards the living-room fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give ’em to me!” He reached for them angrily, and that
gave her an idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they’re mine!” Standing at the end of the box, which
made a barrier between them, she held them mockingly just
beyond his reach. He came forward, then perceiving one foot was
right across the forbidden sill, he jerked himself back violently.
Then balancing himself well on his soles, with a sudden swoop he
curved his body forward to the utmost. It only resulted in his
nearly falling athwart the open box. He recovered his balance
and the perpendicular with some difficulty and no dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take care!” she cried in almost hysterical gaiety. “You
nearly crossed that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You give me my property!” he cried furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re as much mine as yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not by law. You’ve no legal right to detain my property.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who’s detaining it? You’ve only got to come and
take it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His anger was enhanced by the sounds of Daniel Quarles
returning with the cart, a carolling, lumbering, barking medley.
It would be intolerable to be caught as though trying to cross
the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it me,” he hissed. “I don’t want to meet him.” And
as she tantalizingly tendered the packet nearer, he lunged
towards her at a desperate angle, and overreaching himself as
she deftly withdrew it, fell prone into the open box, his legs
asprawl in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curl ’em in, quick,” she whispered, with an inspiration, tucking
his legs in before he knew what was happening. But as the
lid closed on him, he was not sorry to be spared the encounter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get rid of him!” he implored through the keyhole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Business pouring in, Gran’fer!” she cried cheerily, as the
Gaffer came up astare. “Bear a hand! No, no, not into
the cart. It’s to wait here. <span class='it'>There is Hey</span>,” she began
chanting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>There is Ree</span>,” came his antiphone, as he grasped the other
handle. “Lord, that’s lugsome!” he panted, dropping it as
soon as it was inside and letting himself fall upon it. “Whew!”
he breathed heavily. Nip, too, all abristle leaped on the box
and yapped hysterically, as though nosing for a rat. This was
the last straw. Will, whose head the Gaffer was pressing through
the far from inflexible lid, and who already felt asphyxiating,
gave a vigorous heave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s aloive!” cried the Gaffer, jumping up nervously.
Then as the lid flew up, Nip was hurled into space and Will’s
red poll popped up. “It’s a Will-in-the-box,” cried Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Willie Flynt!” gasped the Gaffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Gran’fer,” she said in laughing triumph. “<span class='it'>And you
carried him in!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, ha, ha!” A great roar of glee came from the jubilant
junior, and in the act of scrambling up, his knees relaxed in
helpless mirth and he let himself fall forward once more in the
box, in a convulsion of merriment. “Daniel Quarles, Carrier!
Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And see, Gran’fer!” cried Jinny in still greater triumph.
“<span class='it'>He came in on his hands and knees!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daniel Quarles’s bemused countenance changed magically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, ho, ho!” he croaked. “On his hands and knees!
Ho, ho, ho!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will’s spasms froze as by enchantment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along, Will,” said Jinny, hauling him out. “It’s a
fair draw and you’ve got to shake hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will manfully put out his hand. “You nearly squashed me,
Mr. Quarles,” he said ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye wanted settin’ on,” said the Gaffer, chuckling, and he
took the fleshy young hand in his bony fingers. “Ye sot yourself
to ruin us. But what says the Book?” he demanded
amiably. “He that diggeth a pit shall tumble into——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A box,” wound up Jinny merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi never knowed he was there, did, Oi’d a-tarned that key,”
said her grandfather, guffawing afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And everybody would have thought me in Australia, and
then after long years a skeleton would have been found,” said
Will, with grim humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny clapped her hands. “Just like Mr. Flippance’s play,
<span class='it'>The Mistletoe Bough</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had closed the house-door. A timid tapping at it, which
had gone unobserved, now grew audible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s your dad!” said Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will’s eyes widened. “My dad?” he breathed incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Git in the box!” whispered the Gaffer, almost bursting with
glee. “Git in the box!” His sinewy arms seized the young
man round the waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will struggled indignantly. “I nearly choked!” he spluttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sh!” Jinny with her warning finger and dancing eyes
stilled him. “Just for fun—only for a moment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her instinct divined that to let the old man have his way
would be the surest method of clinching the reconciliation. He
could then never go back on her later, never resent the trick
played upon him. It would become <span class='it'>his</span> trick, <span class='it'>his</span> farce, it would
provide a fund of happy memories for the rest of his life. And
as she cried “Come in!” and the latch lifted and Caleb’s white-rimmed,
cherubic countenance was poked meekly through a gap,
while her grandfather, stroking his beard, composed his face to
an exaggerated severity, Jinny felt that life was almost too
delicious for laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, young chap!” was the Gaffer’s genial greeting.
“What brings you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi—Oi happened to be passin’,” explained Caleb awkwardly,
while his puzzled eyes roved from the girl to his senior, and then
towards Nip, who was cowering in a corner, too nerve-shattered
to leap on the lid again. “You ain’t seen my Willie?” He
moved forward questingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man tried to answer, then a guffaw burst from that
toothless mouth, and turning his back he blew his nose thundrously
into his handkerchief, while his lean sides shook like a
jelly. “Why ever should we see your Willie?” cried Jinny,
saving the situation. “Ain’t he gone furrin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caleb rubbed his eyes. “But Oi seen him at this door—he’ll
be late for the coach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this door?” the Gaffer succeeded in saying, and then his
handkerchief came into play again and he sneezed and coughed
and blew like a grampus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi seen him just by the sill, swingin’ forth and back like a
parrot on a perch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that Jinny had some pains to keep a stiff lip, and even the
box-lid quivered, but not with laughter, she surmised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you must have dreamed it,” she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord!” quoth Caleb, and dropped dazedly on the box. To
see the Gaffer’s face when the lid shot up under his visitor was
worth more than Mr. Flippance’s finest show. The very soul of
old English mirth was there. You would have thought that this
crude device had never entered human brain before, was as fresh
as the first laughter of Eden. And what heightened the humour
of the situation was that Caleb was by no means overpleased to
find Will had no intention of catching his coach. Nor did he
begin to enter into the spirit of the thing till, admitting that
Martha would “exult in gladness,” it occurred to him what a
surprise for her it would be to get her boy delivered back to her
inside the box. Eagerly the two old men imagined the scene,
catching fire from each other, improvising Martha’s dialogue for
her, from her amazement at seeing the box back, down to the
colossal climax, till the mere idea had them both rolling about in
helpless quiverings and explosions. Nor could Will, though he
said he’d be danged if he’d stuff himself in again, and groused he’d
got cramp in every limb, altogether escape the contagion, while
to witness the roisterous merriment of the two hairy ancients
gave Jinny such an exquisite joy of life as not even her lover’s
first kiss had given her. Such an assurance streamed from it of
life being sound at the centre: a bubbling fount of sweetness
and love and innocent laughter. It wiped out for ever the
memory of that morbid doubt of the nature of things that had
assailed her as she sat under the gaze of the stuffed owl in Mrs.
Pennymole’s cottage, the day of the rape of Methusalem. Tears
welled through her smiles as Will at last bade his father lend a
hand in transporting the box to the waiting cart. It must
return to Frog Farm, even if he was not inside it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I don’t believe there ever <span class='it'>were</span> any provisions, Jinny,”
he grinned, with an afterthought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, there are,” said Jinny. “Look! And a bottle of
brandy too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear!” he began, but Jinny cut him short with warning
signals. The sudden revelation of their relations might undo all
the good of the spree, by reviving her grandfather’s apprehensions
of desertion. Indeed, when the hurly-burly was over, he could
scarcely fail to ask himself what this sportive intimacy of the
young couple portended, especially as he had even in the past
suspected the answer. The truth must be broken to him
cautiously, and with that reflection came the chilling remembrance
that all this hubbub and laughter had solved nothing, that the
situation, though superficially eased, was essentially the same as
before, that the problem had only been postponed. Putting Will
in a box was not keeping him in England. He would probably
have to sail just the same, and the pain of parting be borne
afresh, and even if he remained, she could not abandon her
grandfather. But she shook off these thoughts. Enough for
the moment that Will was hers again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ve never laughed so much since Oi seen that Andraa at
Che’msford Fair the day Oi fust met Annie!” said her grandfather,
wiping his eyes, as she set off on her delayed round, with
Will at her side, and Caleb and the box in the cart, and Nip
bounding like mad along the muddy road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was impossible to keep Caleb in mind. Will was too impatient
and too famished a lover for that, and it is not often that
you sit at your sweetheart’s side when you ought to be whirling
towards the Antipodes. Caleb could not help seeing happy
backs, circumplicated—in the more solitary roads—by arms, and
the hope, first implanted by Martha, that he would be relieved of
Will after all, and in so desirable a fashion, grew more and more
assured, though the occasional rigidity of the bodies under observation
unsettled him afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you late for the coach?” he heard Bundock’s voice
inquire at one of these prim intervals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, too early!” laughed Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re going the wrong way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first time I’ve gone right!” said Will, and with magnificent
indiscretion he turned and kissed Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear!” Jinny gasped, red as fire. “It’ll be all over
Chipstone by to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted the banns proclaimed as soon as possible,” he said,
unabashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they became aware of a curious gulping sound behind
them which drowned even Methusalem’s tick-tacks. They turned
their heads. Caleb—convinced at last—had buried his face in
the famous “muckinger” mentioned between them only that
morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up, dad?” cried Will sympathetically. “Got a
toothache?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the joy at you and Jinny,” he sobbed apologetically.
“And to think that some folk are near-sighted and can’t see
God, their friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning me, dad?” asked Will, not untouched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanin’ mother, Willie. Lord, what a state Oi left her in—all
blarin’ and lamentation. ‘Have faith,’ Oi says to her. But
Oi’m afeared she’s got too much brains and book-larnin’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say, dad!” laughed Will. “Wouldn’t Bundock like
to hear that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bundock’s of the same opinion,” said Caleb, meaning the
bed-ridden Bundock. “ ‘Few texts and much faith,’ he says to
me once. And faith cometh by hearin’, don’t one of ’em tell us?
Singafies the ear can’t take hold of a clutter o’ texts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but surely Mrs. Flynt has faith?” protested Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s too taken up with other folks’ faith,” Caleb maintained
stoutly. “Wanted Mrs. Skindle to break bread with her and
look for the New Jerusalem—she ain’t found much of a Jerusalem,
poor lone widder. And wanted to baptize that Flip
gen’leman, but he never would come to the scratch. And tried
her tricks and texts on your poor old Gran’fer, she let out. But
when it comes to takin’ a sorrow from the hand of God, her
friend, she sets and yowls like a heathen what runs naked in the
wilderness. Oi’m done with that Christy Dolphin stuff—it don’t
bring the peace of God, and Oi’ll tell her sow to her head the next
time she’s at me to be a Jew!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mopped up the remains of his tears. “And same as Oi
did jine the Sin agog,” he added pensively, “how do Oi know
she wouldn’t goo on gooin’ forrard?”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>If, in the very heart of the romp at Blackwater Hall, Jinny’s
insight could perceive that this reconciliation of her two males
(or her two mules as she called them to herself) had left her
marriage problem unsolved, still more did afterthought bring
home the sad truth. There was no way of leaving the old man,
no way of adding Will to the household. The latter alternative
she never even suggested. It would bring her husband into
public contempt to be thus absolutely swallowed up by the
female carrier, and supported as in a poorhouse. So far off
seemed the possibility of marriage that the Gaffer was considerately
left in ignorance of the engagement—the only man in
a radius of leagues from whom it was hidden, though Will was
constantly about the cottage, having supplanted poor Ravens as
a house repairer. But ever since the Gaffer had clapped him in
the trunk—and the old man had forgotten he was not the first
to do so—his affections had passed to the victim of his humour,
and he often recalled it to Will with grins and guffaws as they
sat over their beer. “Ye thought to git over Daniel Quarles,”
he would chuckle, poking him in the ribs, “but ye got to come
in on your hands and knees! Ho, ho, ho!” He seemed to
imagine Will called on purpose to be thus twitted with his defeat,
though as a matter of fact the privation of his pipe was a great
grievance to the young man, and supplied a new obstacle to his
taking up his quarters there as son-in-law. But outwardly Will
had fallen into Jinny’s way of humouring the old tyrant, and
this parade of affection rather shocked her, for she felt that Will
was more interested in the veteran’s death than in his life. Once
when, recalling the delectable memory, the Gaffer remarked,
“Lucky ye ain’t as bonkka as Sidrach, Oi count they had to
make him a extra-sized coffin,” she caught an almost ghoulish
gleam in her lover’s eyes. He had indeed lugubriously drawn
her attention to a paragraph in the paper saying that six thousand
centenarians had been counted in Europe in the last half-century.
Evidently the age of man was rising dangerously, he implied.
The worst of it was that Jinny herself, though she would have
fought passionately for the patriarch’s life, found shadowy
speculations as to the length of his span floating up to her mind
and needing to be sternly stamped under. For she had told
Will definitely that so long as her grandfather lived, she could
neither marry nor leave England. Gloomily he cited Old Parr—he
seemed to have become an authority on centenarians—who
had clung to existence till 152. “At that rate I shall be over
eighty,” he calculated cheerlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it isn’t very likely!” she consoled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s lucky we aren’t living before the Flood, that’s all
I can say,” he grumbled. “Fancy waiting six hundred years
or so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we were living before <span class='it'>our</span> flood,” she said. “Then
you’d have your livelihood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what would have been the good of that without you?
You’d have stuck to your grandfather just the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, there was no way out. Australia resurged, black and
menacing, and finally she even wrote herself to the London
agents about his ship, consoled only by the entire supervision of
his wardrobe and the famous trunk. And the only wedding that
followed on their engagement was Elijah’s. For—according to
Bundock’s father—till that had become certain, Blanche had
refused to marry, despite the calling of her banns. “I didn’t
think that a man who once aspired to me could ever keep company
with a common carrier,” was her final version to Miss
Gentry. “It shows how right you were to spurn him,” said
that sympathetic spinster, who had transferred her adoration of
the Beautiful from the faithless Cleopatra to the clinging Blanche,
and figured at the altar in her now habitual rôle of bridesmaid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was on that very wedding-day—so closely does tragedy
tread on the sock of comedy—that poor Uncle Lilliwhyte fell
asleep in a glorious hope of resurrection. Jinny had not suspected
the imminence of his last moments till the evening before,
though she and Will had paid him several visits at his now
weathertight hut. But she had become rather alarmed about
him, and returning from her round one Tuesday, she set off
alone, as soon as supper was over. Will had seen sufficient of
her during the day, and it was understood he was to give his
mother his company that evening, for Martha had fallen into a
more distressful state than ever. “Will’s got to go just the
same,” she kept moaning when Jinny came, “and Flynt vows
he’ll never be baptized into the Ecclesia, and turns round and
tells me I lack faith. Me, who’ve learnt him all the religion
he knows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a full moon as Jinny set out with a little basket for
the invalid. Nip trotted behind her, and the trees and bushes
cast black trunks and masses across her path, almost like solid
stumbling-blocks. The bare elms and poplars rose in rigid
beauty in the cold starry evening. Death was far from her
thoughts till she reached the hut and saw the sunken cheeks in
their tangle of hair illumined weirdly from the stove, which lay
so close to the patriarch’s hand he could replenish it from his
bed of sacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just in time, Jinny!” he said joyfully. “Oi was afeared
you wouldn’t be.” His excitement set him coughing and,
frightened, she knelt and put her jug of tea to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! Don’t talk nonsense!” she said, as a faint colour
returned to his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “ ’Tis the tarn of the worms at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for twenty years. Look at Gran’fer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi can’t grudge ’em,” he persisted. “Oi’ve took many a
fish with ’em, and Oi’ve been about the woods from a buoy-oy,
master of beast and bird and snake, and Oi know’d Oi’d be
catched myself one day. And that’s onny fair, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk like that—it’s horrible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye’re too softy-hearted, Jinny, or ye wouldn’t be here
fussin’ over the poor ole man in the trap. And ef ye’d been
more of a sport, ye’d ha’ understood it’s all a grand ole game.
<span class='it'>Catch-me-ef-you-can</span>, Oi calls it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s dreadful, I think—the hawks and weasels eating the
little birds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do the little birds sing so? Tell me that! It’s
all fun, Oi tell ye, and they’re havin’ it theirselves with the flies
and the worms. Take your Nip now. [Nip, hearing his name,
wagged his tail.] Oi’ve seen that animal, what looks so peaceful
squattin’ there by the fire, stand a-roarin’ like when you shuts
the flap o’ the stove time he tries to git at a rat-hole. Ten men
couldn’t howd him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s never got a rat anyhow,” said Jinny with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More shame to his breed. Oi count he’s frighted away my
fox all the same. There’s one what comes and looks in at me
every evenin’ just like Nip there, onny wild about the eyes
like. Oi reckoned he’d be squattin’ there to-night for a warm, too,
friendly-like, but he’ll find both on us cowld soon, the fire and
me.” And a racking spasm of coughing accented his prognostic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t talk like that. You mustn’t talk at all. I’ll
send Dr. Mint to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised himself convulsively on his sacking, throwing off the
rags and tags that covered him, and revealing the grimy shirt
and trousers that formed his bed-costume. His grey hair
streamed wildly, almost reaching the bolster. “Ef ye send me
a doctor,” he threatened, “Oi’ll die afore he gits here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do lie down.” She pressed him towards his bolster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi won’t take no doctors’ stuff,” he gurgled, as his head
sank back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?” she said, covering him up with his fusty bedclothes.
“You’re not one of us, surely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Peculiar? Noa, thank the Lord. Oi told ye Oi don’t
believe nawthen of all they religions. Git over me, the whole
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if you won’t have medicine, you must pray, like we do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye don’t catch me doin’ the one ne yet the tother. Oi
count Oi can git along without ’em as much as the other critters
in the wood. They don’t have neither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they do—at least Nip and Methusalem have medicine
when they’re sick. I give it ’em myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi reckon that’s what makes ’em sick—relyin’ on Skindles
and sech. Oi never seen a stoat nor a squirrel take physic, and
ye don’t want nawthen livelier, and Oi never seen a animal goo
down on his knees, unless ’twas a hoss what slipped. He, he, he!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the cough into which his gaggle passed was quieted,
Jinny reminded him sternly that men were not animals, that he
had an immortal soul, and she asked whether he would see
Mr. Fallow or one of the various chapel ministers. That proved
the most agitating question of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat up again, his face working in terror. “None o’ that,
Oi tell ye. Oi ain’t afeared o’ the old black ’un. He’ll end all
my pains, though Oi ain’t tired o’ life even with ’em—no, not by
a hundred year. But do ye don’t come scarin’ me with your
heavens and hells, for Oi don’t want to believe in ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I remember your saying once, we’ve got to have one or
the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Oi told ye Oi mislikes ’em both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not really? You wouldn’t really dislike heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shuddered. “Lord save me from it! Oi’ve thought a
mort lately about that Charley Mott—Oi used to see him drunk
with his mates—and ef he’s in heaven among they parsons and
angels, Oi warrant he’s the most miserable soul alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie down! I oughtn’t to have let you talk!” she said, so
shocked that she charitably supposed his wits were going. This
apprehension was enhanced when, just as her hand had pressed
his relaxing form back to his bolster, she felt him grow rigid
again with an impulse so violent that she was jerked backwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s my wits?” he exclaimed in odd congruity with her
thought. “Oi’ve nigh forgot the teapot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hastened to offer again the half-sipped jug, which she had
stood by the stove. He waved it away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that! Gimme the spade!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, it stands in the corner—Oi ain’t used it since my old
lurcher died. D’ye think he’s in heaven—Rover—and all they
rats we digged up together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not going to dig up a rat?” she said in horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fear. But Oi won’t have nobody else ferret it out.” And
from his bed he tried to shovel away the earth near the stove.
But his strength failed. She took his spade. “I’ll do it.
What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis in the earth,” he panted, “like Oi’ll be. And Oi reckon
Oi’d as soon be buried here as anywheres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned faint. Did he mean her to dig his grave?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t consecrated ground,” she said feebly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi count it’s got as lovely a smell as the churchyard earth,”
he said. “But let ’em bury me where they will, so long as Oi
don’t wake up. Ye ain’t diggin’, Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mystified and trembling, and wishing she had not come
without Will, she stuck the spade in deeper and threw up the
clods. Set her teeth as she might, she could not shake off the
thought that she was digging his grave, and they began to
chatter despite the warmth from the stove. The lurid glow
streaming from it seemed sinister in the darkness of the windowless
hut, and she paused to let in a streak of moonlight through
a gap in the door. But the night outside in its vastness and
under its blue glamour seemed even more frightening, and the
cold blast that blew in made the ancient cough again. She
reclosed the door, and with trembling spade resumed her strange
task. Suddenly her blade struck a metallic object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it!” he cried gleefully. “And ye wanted to put
boards over it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More mystified than ever, she drew up a heavy old teapot of
Britannia metal—never had she handled such a weighty pot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pour it out! Pour it out!” he chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held the spout over her jug, which made him laugh till he
nearly died. But by thumping his shoulders she got his breath
back. She understood now what moved his mirth, for though
nothing had issued from the spout, the lid had burst open and
a rain of gold pieces had come spinning and rolling all over the
hut. It seemed like the stories the old people told of the
treasures of gnomes and pixies. There seemed hundreds of
them, glittering and twirling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All for you, Jinny,” he panted with his recovered breath.
“All for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, wherever did you get all this?” she replied, dropping
on her knees to gather the shimmering spilth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all honest, Jinny, don’t be scat. ’Tis the pennies
Oi’ve put together, man and buo-oy this sixty year and more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what for?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For you. And fowrpence or fi’pence a day tots up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I mean why did you do it?” Her brain refused to
take in the idea that all this fabulous wealth was hers. “Why
didn’t you live more comfortable—why didn’t you get another
cottage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi ain’t never been so happy as since Farmer tarned me
out. To lay on the earth, that’s what Oi wanted all my life—onny
Oi dedn’t know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what was the good of the money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crafty look came into the hollow eyes and overspread the
wan features. “They’d have had me, they guardians, ef Oi
dedn’t have money. Oi wasn’t a-gooin’ to die in the poorhouse
like my feyther, time they sold him up. Ef ye got the brads,
they can’t touch ye. Do, the Master ’ould git into trouble. They
put mother and me sep’rit from feyther, and when Oi seen her
cryin’ Oi swore in my liddle heart Oi’d die sooner than stay
there or tarn ’prentice. Oi dropped through a window the
night o’ feyther’s funeral—for the Master had thrashed me—but
Oi’d promised mother Oi’d come back for her, and ’twarn’t
many year afore she was livin’ with me upright in the cottage.
Happen you seen her, though she never seen you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know,” said Jinny softly. “She was blind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cried her eyes out, to my thinkin’. But Oi says to her
marnin’ and night, ‘Cheer up, mother,’ Oi says, ‘so long as we’ve
got the dubs, they can’t touch us, and ef they parish gents tries
to lay hands on me, they’ll git such a clumsy thump with the
teapot they’ll know better next time.’ She never seen the teapot,
mother dedn’t, but she used to waggle her fingers about in it
and laugh like billy-o.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny felt nearer weeping as she culled these spoils of a lifetime.
Many of the coins were curious; mintage of an earlier
reign. She was peering in a cobwebbed corner when the barking
of Nip as well as a familiar footstep in the clearing announced a
welcome arrival. How glad she was Will had not been able to
keep away! And then suddenly—at last—came the realization
of her riches, of the solution of her financial problem!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick! Quick!” whispered the old man hoarsely, and
signed to her to hide the teapot. To soothe him she put it
swiftly in her basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure there’s nobody else ought to have it?” she
asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi ain’t got no friend ’cept you and the fox. And ye don’t
catch <span class='it'>him</span> in the poorhouse. But Oi’ll die happy, knowin’ as
Oi’ve saved <span class='it'>you</span> from it. Don’t let ’em come in!” he gasped, as
a tapping began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only young Mr. Flynt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Willie, d’ye mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She blushed in the friendly obscurity. “He’s come to see me
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He mustn’t come in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She set down the basket and went out into the blue night. It
was no longer terrifying. Will with his ash stick seemed a
match for all the powers of darkness. But she drew back from
his kiss. Death was too near. In whispers she explained the
situation, forgetting even to mention the gold. “I oughtn’t to
leave him—he oughtn’t to die alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, sweetheart. You can’t stay all night with a dirty
old lunatic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk so unchristianly, Will. You don’t deserve——!”
But she shut her lips. She could not go now into the happiness
the “dirty old lunatic” was bringing them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make him up a good fire and say you’ll be back first thing
in the morning. I’ll come and take you. There!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t—couldn’t <span class='it'>you</span> stay with him, Will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? You said he wouldn’t have me! And I haven’t got
enough baccy on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went back tentatively. She found Uncle Lilliwhyte lying
on his back on his sacks with closed eyes, and there was blood
on the bolster. The earth had been shovelled in again and the
soil flattened tidily with the back of the spade. The superfluous
precaution—automatic effect of lifelong habit—had evidently
cost him dear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can come in now,” he said feebly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he doesn’t want anything,” she explained. “You lie
still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’d like him to come.” She went softly to the door and
called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I am, uncle!” cried Will cheerily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tain’t you Oi want. But happen ef your mother ’ud come
and talk things over——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother?” said Will, startled. Martha, he knew, would
have the same repugnance as he to this feckless, grimy, impossible
creature: an aversion which even the wasted features could not
counteract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It don’t seem to git over she,” he explained, “but Oi never
could hear proper, bein’ at the keyhole in a manner o’ speakin’.
But ef she’d come and explain——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she will,” said Jinny. “She must, Will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell her,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll bring her in the morning,” she promised emphatically.
“You take a little more tea now and get to sleep.” She covered
him up carefully and stuck a great log in the stove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do ye take that fowlin’-piece, young Flynt,” he said, opening
his eyes. “And be careful—it’s loaded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, I’ll take it in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s the coppers and silver, Jinny. That’s at the
bottom o’ the sack Oi’m on. And old tradesmen’s tokens too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the morning—you go to sleep now,” she said tenderly.
But she still lingered, reluctant to leave him, and was very relieved
when Ravens (now become a woodman with an adze) looked in
to see the old man, and, unembittered by the sight of the lovers,
consented to pass the night in the hut he had mended.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Swinging home through the wood, through aisles flooded only
with moonlight, the young lovers soon left the thought of death
behind them. Indeed from the hut itself there had soon come
following them the careless strains of the incurable caroller:</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“What a hefty basket!” said Will at last. “Whatever have
you been carrying the old codger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s what I’m carrying off,” she laughed. “But give it me,
if it’s too much for your poor arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not so heavy as my box,” he smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it saves carrying that,” she said happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s your farm in there—your English farm! Australia
is off.” She enjoyed his obvious fear that the scene in the hut
had been too much for her brain. “Goose!” she cried. “Goose
with the golden eggs. Just take a peep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s only your jug and teapot.” He was more mystified
than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her happiness waned again when the riddle was read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You surely don’t expect me to pocket <span class='it'>your</span> money,” he said,
as soon as his slower brain had taken in the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Will! Surely what is mine is yours!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. What is mine is yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s what I said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t turn and twist—I know you’re cleverer than me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand sought his. “Don’t let us have a storm in a teapot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he rumbled on. “With all my worldly goods I thee endow—it’s
the man says that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been reading the marriage service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how would you know it, if <span class='it'>you</span> hadn’t?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That suspended the debate on a kiss. “You see I’d be almost
as bad as poor Charley Mott,” he pointed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” she said humbly. Indeed she felt herself so much a
part of him now that she wondered how she could have failed
to look at it from his point of view. Her defeat of his coach—under
Providence—had humiliated him enough. To have turned
suddenly into an heiress was an aggravation of her success; now
to make him appear a fortune-hunter would be the last straw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But couldn’t I buy the farm and you rent it of me?” she
ventured, with a memory of Hezekiah Bidlake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody would think just the same——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but somewhere else—where nobody knows us——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t come somewhere else—not till I’m eighty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be absurd! Anyhow you’ll look beautiful with a
white beard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not get him a minder with the money? Then we
could go to Australia together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave him to a stranger! He’d die. But so long as the
farm was in England, it wouldn’t be so bad, even if I couldn’t
come just yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer, and as they walked on silently, her daydreams
resurged, her nipped buds began bursting into wonderful
flower. They parted at her door without further reference to
money questions, but her face was brimming with happiness as
the pot with guineas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that rosy mood—when her grandfather, nid-nodding over
the hearth, roused at her return—she could not refrain from
pouring out her teapot on the table, and changing his grumbles
at her absence into squeaks of delight. She meant to pour out
her story too, but he cut her short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s mine!” he cried, exultant. “That’s the gold Sidrach
brought me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Gran’fer. That comes from——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s the wery spade guineas!” He dabbled his
claws in the coins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is that what they are? But there’s heads of Victoria,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what he saved in Babylon. Dedn’t Oi say as he died
warrum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you <span class='it'>must</span> listen, Gran’fer. Uncle Lilliwhyte——” she
recapitulated the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re mine anyways!” He scooped them up in his
skinny palms and let them fall into the pot with a voluptuous
clang. “Ye gits quite enough out o’ my biznus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seemed so exactly the reverse of Will’s attitude that she
found herself smiling ruefully at the way she was caught again
between her “two mules.” But she could not thus lose her
marriage-portion. “Uncle Lilliwhyte gave them to me for
myself,” she said firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t ye owe me back all the money Oi paid when your
feyther died?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was taken aback. “How much did you pay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hunderds and hunderds. Dedn’t, he’d a-been a disgraced
corpse, and your mother too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jinny was silent. The Angel-Mother seemed rustling overhead.
The Gaffer closed shutters and bolted doors with rigorous precautions,
and hugging the teapot to his bosom stumbled up to
bed. Depressed by this unexpected seizure of her windfall, she
found herself too utterly weary after her long day’s work and
excitement to open the shutters again, much as she disliked an
airless room; she had scarcely energy to pull out her chest of
drawers. For a few minutes she watched from her bed the blue
flickering flame of the log, then knew no more till suddenly she saw
above the dead fire a monstrous shadow curling over the chimney-piece
and along the ceiling: in another instant she traced it to
something still more horrible—her grandfather’s legless trunk
appearing over the hearthstone, with his nightlight in one hand
and the teapot in the other. The rush-candle shook in its holed
tin cylinder and set his grisly counterpart dancing. Jinny’s blood
ran cold. Evidently some one had murdered him for the gold
and this was his ghost. Then she told herself it was one of her
nightmares, and she looked around for Henry Brougham, Esq.,
to clear up the situation. But with a soft thud the trunk dropped
as through a trap-door and there was nothing left but a great
glimmering hole where the hearthstone should have been.
Instantly she realized that it was only a secret hiding-place in
which her magpie of a grandfather was bestowing the treasure—yes,
there was the hearthstone slewed round as on a pivot. This
must be that old smugglers’ storehouse he and gossip had sometimes
hinted at—with perhaps the long underground passages of
ancient legend, reaching to Beacon Chimneys, nay, to the
parsonage itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She closed her eyes carefully as his shadow heralded his re-ascent.
He came up almost as noiselessly as that giant spectre,
and between her lids she saw him scrutinize her. Reassured to
see his shanks again, she emitted one of his snores, wondering
whimsically if she did snore, or if any other girl had ever heard
herself snore, and a smile almost broke the impassivity of her
cheeks. Satisfied with the snore, he stooped down and she saw
the hearthstone veer back to its place. “Well, I can always get
it when I want it,” she thought cheerfully, as his slow stockinged
feet bore him and his more sinister shadow upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time she lay awake, pondering over the fate of her
money, which seemed like Cleopatra’s to be “in bonds,” and
wondering whether poor Uncle Lilliwhyte was still alive; then
everything faded into a vision of Mr. Flippance jogging marionettes
for rugged miners who poured out their teapots at the
box-office, reducing it to such a swamp that its boxes floated
in the tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At breakfast, finding her grandfather abnormally restless, she
asked him a little maliciously if he had slept all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ll sleep better to-night,” he said, and chuckled a little.
He seemed indeed very happy at having his treasure so well
warded, and though his exuberance was alarming, she felt that
the excitement of happiness was a lesser danger than that long
depression of penuriousness. If the defeat of the coach had
seemed to give him a second lease of life, what might not his new
wealth do for him? He might really become an Old Parr, and
poor Will be kept waiting till the twentieth century!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was thus with only a moderate uneasiness that she left him,
stealing with her basket to the rendezvous at the hut. In the
wood she met Ravens hurrying to find breakfast, and he sang
out that Martha and Will had relieved him, and that Uncle
Lilliwhyte was better. As she approached the clearing, she saw
the old woman come out of the hut with a bottle in her hand
and a face absolutely transfigured. The whining, peevish,
latter-day Martha was gone: a radiance almost celestial illumined
her features—it seemed to transcend even the bonnet and to rim
it with a halo. This was a woman walking not on the dead
dank leaves of a frost-grey wood, but through the streets of the
New Jerusalem. Behind her came Will, with a little cynical
smile playing about his mouth till he espied Jinny, when his
face took on the same ecstatic glow as his mother’s. Jinny
could not but feel enkindled in her turn by all this spiritual
effulgence, and it was three glorified countenances that met on
this March morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s broken bread with me,” breathed Martha, “and I’ve
helped him put on the Saving Name.” She displayed her bottle
with drops of water beaded on the mouth. She had baptized—albeit
only by an unavoidable reversion to sprinkling—her first
convert. The dream of years had been fulfilled at last, and the
apostolic triumph had lifted her beyond humanity, fired her
with a vision in which, a conquistador of faith, she was to turn
all Little Bradmarsh, nay, Chipstone itself, into one vast synagogue.
This were indeed the New Jerusalem. “And it was
Will that led my feet,” she said, kissing him to his disconcertment.
“And go where he may now, Jinny, he can’t take that
away from me. And I shall always have his letter to inspire me
to win other souls.” She touched the left side of her bodice, and
poor Jinny, suddenly reminded that her grandfather had robbed
her of her last chance of keeping Will in England, felt envious
of Martha’s exalted source of consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to go now and cook Flynt’s dinner,” said Martha.
“But he won’t have much appetite for it if he’s got any right
feeling left, when he hears that another man, a stranger, has
been before him in the path of righteousness. Maybe you’ll
write to the <span class='it'>Lightstand</span>, Willie, to say there’s a new brother in
Little Bradmarsh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell ’em the Ecclesia has doubled its membership,” said
Will, with a faint wink at Jinny, to which the girl did not respond.
“Do you think, mother,” he asked with mock seriousness, “the
New Jerusalem will come down in Australia same as here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Martha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Will winked at Jinny. But she frowned and shook her
head. Her study of Australia had instructed her sufficiently
that it was on the other side of the globe, and she knew that
Will was having fun with the idea of the golden city coming
down two opposite ways at once, but she felt it criminal to break
Martha’s mood, and indeed was not certain she herself understood
how the Australians escaped falling off into space. Discouraged
by her stern face, Will murmured he’d put his mother
on the road and be back. She smiled and nodded at the promise,
but her heart was heavy with a sense of inevitable partings as
she went in to the lingering ancient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The death-bed conversion was evidently a success, for she
found him almost as radiant as Martha, though with a more
unearthly light, while the gleaming as of dewdrops on his dishevelled
hair, and the stains of damp over his bolster seemed to
convict his spiritual preceptress of a dangerous recklessness.
But he was probably beyond saving in any case, Jinny reflected,
and what other medicine could have given him that happy
exaltation? The logs roared in the stove, and all was joy and
warmth that rimy morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oi’ve tarned a Christy Dolphin!” he announced jubilantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m so glad. Drink this before it gets cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waved it away. “Oi suspicioned all the time as that be the
right religion. No hell at all, ye just goos to sleep, and when
the New Jerusalem comes down for they righteous, ye don’t
git up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You’ll</span> wake up—you and your mother,” she assured him,
standing her jug by the stove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Mrs. Flynt says. ‘Ye ain’t done no harm,’ she
says, ‘and when the trumpet blows for the saints, your bones will
git their flesh agen, same as now.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was little enough on them to go through eternity in, she
thought, gazing at his shrunken arms, which he had left outside
the coverings in repudiating the tea. “Won’t that be wonderful!”
she said, the tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be wunnerful wunnerful,” he agreed. “That fares to
be what Oi calls a real heaven—your own body, not a sort o’
smoke-cloud ye wouldn’t know was you ef you met it, your own
flesh and blood, livin’ on this lovely earth with the birds and the
winds and the sun and the water, all a-singin’ and a-shinin’ for
ever and ever. And no bad folks ne yet angels to worrit ye, no
liddle boys to call arter ye—why it’s just ginnick! Oi reckon
Oi’ll choose this same old spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s a lovely spot,” said Jinny, but she wondered whether
he had not made his own version of Martha’s New Jerusalem,
which she herself had always understood to be more jewelled
than natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother will be able to <span class='it'>see</span> it too,” she added gently, as
she put the tea to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A beautiful smile traversed the sunken features. But suddenly
a frenzy of terror swamped it. He sat up with a jerk that dashed
her jug to the stove, shivering it into fragments. “But ef Oi
waked, Oi’d need my money agen!” he shrilled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Jinny always remembered most vividly, when she
recalled this tragic moment, was the red lettering on the sacks
he lay on, exposed by his upright posture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gay, Bird &amp; Co., Colchester,” her eyes read mechanically.
When he fell back and hid that inscription, his face was at peace
again. That acuteness of terror—the quintessence of the morbidity
of a lifetime—had stopped his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was terribly shaken by this sudden and grotesque end.
She felt his pulse, but without hope. She had never seen human
death before, but she had a vague idea that you closed the eyes
and put pennies on them. She had no pennies with her. She
remembered there were some in the sack he lay on, pennies and
shillings, but she did not dare disturb him to get at them. She
was obscurely glad she had not to wrestle with the problem of
whether she ought to get his teapot buried with him, for the
contingency of his resurrection. Her grandfather would never
surrender it, she felt, and if she descended into his mysterious
underground and abstracted it, that might upset his wits altogether.
Besides, Uncle Lilliwhyte’s face was now taking on a
strange beauty, as though his pecuniary anxieties were allayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her nerves were giving way—she threw open the door and
looked out eagerly, not for the lover, but for the man who
seemed necessary in these rough moments. The dead must not
be left alone, she knew that, or she would have set out to meet
Will. Perhaps if she left him alone, his shy friend the fox would
come trotting in, now he was so still. The parish authorities
must doubtless be summoned to take charge of him. But ought
he to have a pauper funeral—ought she not to steal back enough
of his money to save him from that? But she remembered
with relief that he had expressed indifference as to what became
of his body—so long as it was restored to earth, its good old
mother. As she moved a few paces without, in her peering for
Will, she saw the blue smoke rising through the three top-hats,
and in spite of the dead man’s doctrines and apprehensions, she
could not help fancying it was his spirit soaring towards the abode
of the Angel-Mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Will returned, she was relieved to find Ravens striding
beside him. That sunny-souled factotum, who had meant to hie
to the Skindle wedding, now found himself transformed instead
into a corpse-watcher, while Will, taking Jinny a bit of his way,
went off by the shortest cuts to Chipstone Poorhouse, as probably
the centre of authority for parish funerals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the coroner, too,” Ravens called after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will there be an inquest?” Jinny asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must be,” said Will, and Jinny, alarmed for Martha’s sake,
ran back on pretence of her basket, and surreptitiously wiped
the bolster. As they left the clearing, they heard Ravens singing
in the hut.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When their roads parted, Jinny insisted on returning to her
grandfather, whose excitement now recurred to her mind. She
was still a little uneasy about the pauper funeral, but Will had
emphatically agreed with her that the teapot could not now be
recaptured. Nor could it be drawn upon, he declared: the old
grabber would assuredly have counted the contents. Jinny suspected
that Will was pleased rather than sympathetic at her
having ceased to be an heiress. The death of Uncle Lilliwhyte,
so much the junior of Daniel Quarles, could not but set both
their minds on the thought of a similar cutting of their Gordian
knot, but the thought—dreaded or welcome—was not allowed
to appear in their conversation, finding expression only in Will’s
aggrieved assumption of the Gaffer’s immortality. “Even if I
was to strike a nugget as big as a prize marrow, we’d be no
forrarder,” he had grumbled, and Jinny, with jangled nerves,
had accused him of selfishness, when that poor old uncle was
lying dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she approached Blackwater Hall, a creepy conviction began
to invade her that their knot was already cut: after that scene
in the hut she was aquiver with presages of death and disaster.
The absence of smoke—surely Gran’fer’s hearth was not already
cold—added to her alarm. She remembered again his effervescence
at breakfast; why should his heart not stop too?
And when she saw the broad garden-gate open, and the house
door ajar, her own heart nearly stopped. Her intuition, she
felt, had not deceived her. Yet he was nowhere in the house.
Ante-room, living-room, kitchen, all were empty of him. The
fire was out. In the bedroom lay his telescope, a discarded toy.
She was about to sweep the horizon with it, when she had an
inspiration. The smugglers’ storehouse! He had gone down
to count his gold, and the stone had rolled back—<span class='it'>The Mistletoe
Bough</span> in another version. Tearing downstairs, she managed,
after much fumbling with the poker, to make it revolve, and
peered down into the dark clammy depths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gran’fer! Gran’fer!” she cried. But only the dank silence
welled up. He was undoubtedly dead, lying there stark among
his guineas. She was scrambling down into the vault. But no!
What nonsense! He must be pottering about with a spud,
currycombing Methusalem, or doing some other odd job his
renewed strength permitted. She hauled herself up—at any rate
that would postpone the dread vision—and rushed round to the
stable. That door too was open—Methusalem was gone! So
was the cart. Nor was there any sign of Nip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her relief it was almost a pleasure to trace the wheels on
the road. But soon she saw black again. It was his last drive—the
last drive of Daniel Quarles, Carrier. That was the meaning
of his excitement of the morning. He had gone out for the last
time on his old rounds, and would meet Death on his driving-board,
face to face, as he had met so many wintry storms and
buffets. Staying only to roll back the stone, she raced out in
his tracks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his course led unluckily to the Four Wantz Way and
there she could no longer disentangle his cart-ruts. However,
Mrs. Pennymole, reinstated in her scoured ground floor, had reassuring
news enough, though it carried a new apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t believe my eyes when I catched sight of him with
the May Day favours all a-flyin’ and a-flutterin’ on whip and
harness, and lookin’ that strong with a great old smile over his
dear old phiz, and Nip barkin’ fit to bust. ‘Where be <span class='it'>you</span> off
to?’ I cries as he dashes by, whippin’ past like fleck—I never
seen Methusalem go that pace, seemin’ a’most as if he was glad
to have his old master back agen, meanin’ no disrespect to you,
Jinny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not,” said Jinny impatiently. “But what did
he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t rightly hear, I’m tellin’ you, seein’ how he tore
towards the bridge. But ’twas summat about ’Lijah! I yeard
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens!” cried Jinny, and thanking Mrs. Pennymole,
she tore equally towards the bridge, wondering if she could get
a vehicle at “The King of Prussia.” It was clear the old wretch—there
was really no other name for him—had gone to sell
Methusalem again. Set up with all that gold, he meant to
retire, and, inflamed by it, he could not resist the extra five
pounds offered by the vet. And this time Mr. Skindle would
not risk impounding her horse, he would slaughter instanter.
Yes, her eerie premonitions had been justified, but they were
warnings about Methusalem, not about her grandfather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the repaired bridge Farmer Gale’s dog-cart came along with
himself and his wife, but she was too shy to ask for a lift. Nor
was there anything to be got immediately at “The King of
Prussia.” She toiled on through footpaths grey-silted from the
flood till she reached the by-way that branched off to Foxearth
Farm. Here she paused, wondering if it was worth while to go
down it on the chance of finding Barnaby’s trap available. And
while she hesitated, there came bowling by from church the
Skindle wedding-party in grand carriages. But though she
cowered into the hedge, their insolent prosperity only soothed
her somewhat by reminding her that Elijah had other work
to-day than killing, and that, in any case, there was now no
motive for it, unless perhaps revenge. To her surprise, in the
rear of the procession, sharing Barnaby’s bepranked trap, rode
Will. His face beside Barnaby’s seemed one large smile: even
the unexpected sight of herself would hardly explain such broad
cheerfulness in a man who, though profiting by a wedding, had
come from arranging a pauper funeral, not to mention an inquest.
But perhaps he was rejoicing at his escape from that overblown
Blanche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if to corroborate this interpretation, he jumped down and
caught her to him in the open daylight, while Barnaby’s vehicle
sympathetically disappeared after the others round the by-way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jinny, Jinny!” he cried. “Such a lark!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Gran’fer——!” she gasped, extricating herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He burst into a roar of laughter. “Have you heard it
already?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heard what? I’m looking for Gran’fer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you met him on the road? He started back ahead
of me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew a breath of relief. “With Methusalem?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a fare,” he grinned. “I had to go on to the coroner
or else I too——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she no longer heard. “I must have missed him on the
footpaths,” she said happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find him at Mr. Fallow’s,” he said, and then laughter
caught him again and rapt his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do speak! Do speak! What’s this mystery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Gran’fer’s eloped!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wiped the tears from his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do speak!” She almost shook him. “Eloped with who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lijah Skindle’s mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annie?” she murmured involuntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carried her off from the poorhouse! I was only in time for
the tail-end of the fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could he get at her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I tell you I only saw it at the point the Master
came into it. But others saw more, and I’ve picked up spicy
details from the paupers and the wretched porter—Jims, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know Mr. Jims.” A vision of the fat little man in
his peaked cap and blue uniform rose before her. The dismal
brick building in its iron enclosure was half a mile before you
got to Chipstone—administered under the Gilbert Act by half a
dozen parishes clubbed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your Gran’fer, rigged up to the nines with his best
smock and beaver, and ribbons on his whip and a bunch of wallflowers
and primroses sticking out of the spout of the teapot he
carried, rings at the gate, and when Jims came to take in the
parcel, as he thought, the old man pushes through and makes
for the wards, Jims runs after him, and when he asks him what
he wants, he answers, ‘Annie! I’ve come for Annie!’ ‘Who’s
Annie?’ asks Jims. ‘We don’t keep Annies—there’s only old
women, and it ain’t visiting day.’ ‘Do ye don’t tell me no
fibs,’ says your Gran’fer, and when Jims tries to stop him, he
catches him in the stomach with his teapot and leaves him
winded. Then off he scuttles to the stairs, and ‘Where’s
Annie?’ he cries to an old pauper woman sweeping them. This
creature happened to know Mrs. Skindle was Annie, so she says,
‘She’s washing Mr. Robinson in his bedroom.’ ‘What?’
shrieks your Gran’fer, swelling like a turkey-cock with jealousy.
‘You just show me where that bedroom is!’ The frightened
old woman takes him up the stone stairs to the little yellow-ochred
room where they had stowed the old dotard all by himself—I
don’t think he’s as old as your Gran’fer, but he’s quite a
helpless driveller—and there, the old woman told me, your
Gran’fer gives a great cry ‘Annie!’ and Mrs. Skindle drops the
flannel, and there they were crying and laughing and kissing like
two children, and he calling her ‘My darling! My beautiful
Annie!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than you’ve ever called me,” said Jinny, herself
inclined to laugh and cry and even to kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story was interrupted by an idyllic interlude. “But I
expect Gran’fer’s rather short-sighted without a telescope,” she
commented, disentangling herself blushingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was in the Master’s room,” resumed Will, “speaking to
him about the funeral, and hearing a lot about the guardians
and the parish authorities and such-like grand folk, when in
rushes Jims and pants out his tale, and we all race around till
we find the old couple coming down the staircase with arms round
each other’s waists, and your Gran’fer tells us fiercely he’s taking
her away, and opens the teapot to show he can support two wives
if he wants to! ‘Hold hard!’ says the Master. ‘I won’t stop
you, though I ought to have twenty-four hours notice, because
I know the guardians haven’t made such a good bargain with
Mr. Skindle that they’ll try to keep her, but you can’t take
away the parish clothes.’ For of course the old woman was
wearing that blue cotton dress——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s got white stripes if you look close,” put in Jinny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, Oi can’t take her away without clothes,’ roared your
Gran’fer. He said he counted it unrespectable enough that they
should allow her to wash a strange old man, alone in a room, and
that if they didn’t mend their ways he’d have a piece put in the
paper about it all. ‘Well, let ’em give me back my own clothes,’
says Mrs. Skindle. ‘I’ve got to have twenty-four hours’ notice
about that,’ says the Master. ‘Ha, you’ve stole ’em!’ says
your Gran’fer. ‘You be careful what you’re sayin’,’ says the
Master, bridling up. ‘Who wants her rags and jags?’ But in
the end it was all settled friendlywise—your Gran’fer buying up
some of the cast-off grandeur of the matron’s (they drove a good
bargain with your Gran’fer, the pair of screws, but he was free
and flush with his teapot), and off the happy pair went at last,
the bride as spruced up as the bridegroom, and I saw him hand
her into the wedding-cart with her bouquet, while the old
gentlemen in the corduroys and the old ladies in blue, and
especially the little orphans, raised a cheer. Even Jims waved.
I expect he’d had a drop out of the teapot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daniel Quarles, Carrier-Off,” laughed Jinny, half hysterically,
for scandalized and startled though she was, a rosy light, whose
source was yet unclear to her, seemed rising on her horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went up to the cart under pretence of patting Nip,” Will
went on, “and asked the old boy where he was off to. ‘Home,
of course,’ he answers friendly. ‘You should be going to chapel
first, you old rip,’ I told him. ‘We’re going to be married in
church,’ answers Mrs. Skindle stiffly. ‘I’m Church of England.’
‘That’s all right, Annie,’ he says, patting her hand, ‘we’ll look
in on Mr. Fallow about they banns,’ and singing ‘Oi’m Seventeen
come Sunday,’ drives off with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jinny refused to sympathize with the course of true love.
“He’s not really going to marry her?” she now cried. “But
that’s dreadful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You scandalous creature! It would be more dreadful if he
didn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But at his age!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he’s quite young yet,” laughed Will. “One hundred
and fifty-two is his little span, remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let herself relax under his laughter. “Will they ring a
peal of Grandsire Triples at his wedding?” she asked whimsically.
Then with renewed anxiety: “Oh, but I do hope it
hasn’t all excited him too much,” she cried. “I’d best get
home as quick as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home? You don’t mean Blackwater Hall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t go there. As your Gran’fer remarked to the
Master, that’s no place for a respectable female.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at him. “Besides,” he said, “you don’t want to
interfere with the young couple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve not cooked the dinner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the bride do that. She’s as strong as a horse. It’s the
best thing that could have happened for both of ’em. After
fending for all of us at Rosemary Villa, Blackwater Hall will be
a holiday to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must go and see about things. She won’t know where
anything is. And even if she cooks the dinner, she’ll want my
apron. She can’t spoil her fineries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s enough,” he said sternly. “I don’t often quote my
father, but I’m bound to say some people <span class='it'>are</span> near-sighted and
can’t see God, their friend. You’ve done with Blackwater
Hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where am I to go then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed. “And what about Frog Farm?” He took her
arm. “And we, too, must get tied up as soon as possible. No,
Jinny, we can’t do better than follow in your Gran’fer’s footsteps.
The way he held that grey-headed old woman’s hand
in the wedding-cart, while I—you’re right, I haven’t called you
‘beautiful’ enough.” He paused to do so without words.
“The old boy’s taught me a lesson, dashing in like that, while
I’ve been sitting growling and grizzling and wasting our best
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you see, Will, it couldn’t be before. And he <span class='it'>was</span> sacrificing
himself to me, poor Gran’fer, if he wanted her so badly
all the time. Just see how he waited till he could support
her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On your money! Under the roof you re-thatched for
him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t my money. And it was Ravens who did the roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You paid for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t,” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t send me in the bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, won’t he!” Will clenched his fist. “I’ll jolly soon
stop his singing if he don’t hurry up with it! And why didn’t
you ask <span class='it'>me</span> to mend your thatch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t come in to the roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That <span class='it'>might</span> have been a way of coming in,” she laughed,
“it was so leaky. Anyhow you might have done Uncle Lilliwhyte’s—it
is his money that has saved us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a roundabout way,” he admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She snuggled to him. Happiness, which had hitherto seemed
like the soaped pig at village sports, was seizable at last. “Won’t
it be wonderful when we’re in the hut!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened his eyes. “You don’t propose to live in Uncle
Lilliwhyte’s hut with the three top-hats!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” she said, blushing. “It’s in Australia.
There’s just poles stuck in the ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, when have you been in Australia?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind! You see, I’ve already saved up a little
towards my passage and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her words died on his lips. “I don’t know that we need
pull up our stakes,” he said when he released her. “Farmer
Gale’s looking for a looker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t really mean that?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>He</span> does, anyhow. I just met him in his dog-cart and he’s
mad about his flood-losses. ‘You should have paid a good man,’
I told the hunks to his head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but, Will,” she said, shrinking, “you don’t like Farmer
Gale!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he’s safely married now, and after all, my father had
the place first.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It belongs to the family.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyhow,” he
broke off masterfully, “I’d pay my wife’s passage-money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll be able to buy Methusalem,” she said in cheerful
submission. “He’s only five pounds—I suppose your father
would take care of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather! It would be a refuge from the New Jerusalem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’ll take Nip with us, sweetheart—it won’t be the goldfields,
you know, just a farm. And we can take over the Bidlake
girls too, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, what a crowd! But I don’t see Nip on an emigrant
ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t I heard of dog-watches?” she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you’d smuggle him in somehow,” he laughed. “I’ve
noticed you generally get your own way. And captains are
but men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought they were sea-dogs,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You generally get the last word too,” he grumbled with
adoring admiration. “But I tell you, Jinny, though there may
be more money, all these new countries are terribly raw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know—‘no longer an egg, not yet a bird, only a smell,’ ”
she quoted with wistful humour, and these words of his in the
English wood last May evoked again for both of them all the
magic of their love at its dawning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked on in silence towards Frog Farm. After all,
with their united treasure of youth, energy, and love, their livelihood
was no grave problem. Larks were carolling, the little
wrens piping, and ringdoves calling, calling, for the Spring was
near after all, and the daffodils had already come. It seemed
indeed a vain snapping of the heart-strings to leave such a homeland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be winter soon in Australia,” mused Will tenaciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if we were together,” Jinny whispered, although the
more she pondered during that wonderful walk the more the
Antipodes receded to their geographical distance, the more
shadowy grew the danger of falling off her planet. But, however
they were to decide, she could see no reason—once her grandfather’s
wedding-bells had rung—why they should not all live—wherever
they all lived—happy ever after.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
